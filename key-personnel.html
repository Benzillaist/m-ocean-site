										<strong class="bold">Bio: </strong>Tim O’Donnell is a researcher focusing on addressing critical issues related to the health and management of fisheries using molecular tools. Finfish and shellfish are incredibly valuable, both commercially and culturally, on local, regional, and global levels. My passion is to preserve those values by promoting sustainable fisheries using cutting-edge science.The focus of my research is to investigate fundamental aspects of fish populations using advanced molecular techniques. Using genomic sequencing, we can understand genetic population structure, diversity, and effective population size, which are all critical for the accurate assessment and sustainable management of fish stocks. Additionally, I use environmental DNA (eDNA) to learn about the spatial and temporal distribution of important species and how they might interact with anthropogenic activities and changing ocean conditions. Molecular techniques can help us understand the prevalence and impact of disease and viral pathogens on populations, and generate estimates for population census size. I strive to push molecular technology forward by creating innovative tools that can efficiently and accurately provide data-driven insights into critical aspects of fisheries biology and assessment. Using these tools will help us learn more about fish populations and ensure that they are here for decades to come.</div>

										<strong class="bold">Bio: </strong>Dr. Jeanette Davis, also known as Dr. Ocean, is a marine microbiologist, ocean policy practitioner and 2X bestselling children’s science book author. She currently serves as an Assistant Professor in the Marine and Environmental Science Department at her alma mater, Hampton University (HU). Dr. Davis earned her PhD at the University of Maryland, UMCES where her research training focused on assessing bacteria associated with marine sea slugs and their algal diets for medicines. This work ultimately led to the discovery of an marine bacterium that produces an anticancer compound. She served as a NOAA researcher and ocean policy advisor using eDNA tools for fisheries stock assessments and invasive species management. Her current research uses eDNA and bioinformatics to assess bacterial communities associated with marine invertebrates and the local Hampton watershed to uncover potential symbiotic relationships. Dr. Davis is specifically interested in the role of bacteria in the Hampton River to remove pollutants through bioremediation and supporting communities in making informed decisions about their environment through DEIJ efforts and climate justice. At HU, Dr. Davis serves as PI of NSF – Collaborative Research: Building Racial Equity in Marine Science, and co-founder and co-PI of ED – Establishing an Interdisciplinary Climate Science Degree Program at Hampton University.
