1
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.750
Daniel Kuchma: So.

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.210
Daniel Kuchma: Thank you. Everybody for joining us today.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.529
Daniel Kuchma: We are extremely pleased for those who are part of the conversation to provide us some feedback on this proposal.

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.450
Daniel Kuchma: and we also want to chat with you about

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.889
Daniel Kuchma: participation in working groups

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.860
Daniel Kuchma: The way that Nsf. Has done the funding on this particular project

7
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.109
Daniel Kuchma: that you have the money for the first 2 years, and so you do some initial work.

8
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.920
Daniel Kuchma: But then you, during those 2 years you plan for even a larger amount of work that you want to do through years 3 through 10

9
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.220
Daniel Kuchma: and it's the working groups that play a dominant role and then deciding. Where should the bulk of the investment money really go?

10
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.200
Daniel Kuchma: That's why it's very important that we have the communities who need to be working in this space together

11
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.629
Daniel Kuchma: from a logistical perspective for today.

12
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:04.660
Daniel Kuchma: recorded. please introduce yourself in chat, and we're going to share that chat right at record with everybody after the call

13
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.980
Daniel Kuchma: that way we can all get to know each other, feel free to include a link or something like that in it.

14
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.950
Daniel Kuchma: If you think that would be helpful?

15
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.550
Daniel Kuchma: Please also use the chat to make comments and ask questions

16
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.889
Daniel Kuchma: for those of you who have been on various panels and workshops that we've had associated with a couple of bomb projects.

17
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:36.119
Daniel Kuchma: you know we've done this in the past, and it's been extremely extremely helpful as we go through slides, and you hear ideas. If something tweaks in your mind, just drop it in the chat

18
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:51.329
Daniel Kuchma: from a timing perspective, we know when the comment was made. And then that's really helpful for us, because any subset of people only have a limited understanding. So your folks participation on the call, and the ideas that come to your mind are going to be really really helpful to us.

19
00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:07.860
Daniel Kuchma: and we're going to use some of those questions you put forth in chat to incorporate into the discussions. Some of us from the team are going to stay online to 1130 to see if there's other questions. And we're going to be using jam board, which we'll describe later on, and then we'll have some office hours next week

20
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:17.479
Daniel Kuchma: for just people to be able to come and ask various questions, share some thoughts, etc., on the proposal that is going to be shared following this one.

21
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.569
Daniel Kuchma: So let me just reduce this size a little bit here, one sec. So that we get the screen the way I want the screen to be

22
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.400
Daniel Kuchma: okay.

23
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.690
all right.

24
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.480
Daniel Kuchma: because you don't need to see me.

25
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.970
Daniel Kuchma: I'll put myself in there regardless. okay. So

26
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:57.140
Daniel Kuchma: our proposal is called accelerating it just energy transition while naturing help the oceans and new blue economies through innovative nature, inclusive offshore wind farms. So you see a motivation here in the top right image, which is adjacent to one of the monopiles that you see here down at the coast of Virginia offshore wind

27
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.000
Daniel Kuchma: site. So you put stuff in the water. marine Gross and habitats are attracted to it.

28
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:22.209
Daniel Kuchma: This is an image created by an artist. that this work for us at Tufts. So this is a description of what nature inclusive design elements may consider right. So you're doing things. Be that the nature of the service of the concrete, the texture, the materials you're using perforations.

29
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:38.549
Daniel Kuchma: scour, protection, and other types of things, to actually bring benefits to the fisheries, as well as the overall marine ecosystem and offshore wind. As you know, the scales have increased such that this is actually a scuba diver here low resolution. But this gives you sort of a sense of scale.

30
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:54.510
Daniel Kuchma: So we're, i'll do a little bit of introduction to what this Nsf program is about. Then we will have an overview Talk about the team and structure, our strategic and implementation plans, and then our long term sustainability plan as well.

31
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.290
Daniel Kuchma: So

32
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.130
Daniel Kuchma: this is

33
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.629
Daniel Kuchma: I'm. Going to move this to a different location.

34
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.480
1Â s.

35
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:15.220
Daniel Kuchma: This is a brand new thing for Nsf: and it's sort of the boldest thing that they've done. They've created this new directorate called the Technology Innovation partnerships.

36
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.610
Daniel Kuchma: And if i'm it's, I think there's some elements of what was described that's extremely well written.

37
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.010
Daniel Kuchma: and i'm actually going to take a minute or 2 to actually describe what Nsf. Says. This is explicitly about.

38
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.570
Daniel Kuchma: So facing global competition for talent, leadership in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, research and education.

39
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:51.389
Daniel Kuchma: The Us. Must expand its innovation, capacity by leveraging the resources, creativity, and ingenuity that exists across all geographic regions of the country. Right? We obviously have some regions that are stronger than others, and Nsf. Has recognized the Us. Used to be in the leadership on models, all research fronts, but other

40
00:04:51.400 --> 00:05:00.980
Daniel Kuchma: communities, particularly Europe and China, have actually been investing something more than we have. So this is a brand new, bold initiative. It's a different type.

41
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:17.130
Daniel Kuchma: It's about these regional innovation ecosystems, and it's about addressing advancing critical technologies, national and societal challenges. And you need partner things that you need very significant partnerships to be able to do effectively.

42
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.520
Daniel Kuchma: The

43
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.220
Daniel Kuchma: they

44
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.929
Daniel Kuchma: have some smaller size awards. If you're just trying to develop ideas.

45
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.569
Daniel Kuchma: What we've applied for is these 160 million dollar type, 2 engines over 10 years

46
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:49.800
Daniel Kuchma: mit Ctl. And Nsf. Is expecting that they're going to get more money into this program of a significant nature, because there's support from Congress about the Us. Being more competitive globally, as it pertains to use inspired research and advancing us industry. So they're planning on doing some things that are even 100

47
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.210
Daniel Kuchma: larger levels of funding down the line.

48
00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:10.910
Daniel Kuchma: So when they were describing the program, they said, Sort of what is it about? Well, it's about R. And D. Innovation to achieve regional and economic growth. Right? You need partnerships. We have to figure out how we translate innovation to practice and comprehensive workforce development.

49
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.790
Daniel Kuchma: in the area that we're working, and in all activities it's all about creating a very inclusive innovation ecosystem

50
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:26.329
Daniel Kuchma: to try and address some of the disparities. We know very much that we have in society, and it's something that they want to last for a very long time.

51
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:35.070
Daniel Kuchma: So this is something we actually think is very feasible, given our topic, and how we expect growth to develop monies in the industry, etc.,

52
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.059
Daniel Kuchma: and the engine is supposed to be really flexible

53
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:46.819
Daniel Kuchma: from the leadership accountability, and to in order to be able to constantly be revising objectives based on what is learned.

54
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.810
Daniel Kuchma: there's a couple of points that they

55
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.110
Daniel Kuchma: suggest our key considerations. One is sort of the region of service.

56
00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:14.410
Daniel Kuchma: and with that they said, we don't want you to just have a proposal on something you could do anywhere, and to some degree you could say that for biotech micro electronics, you know AI etc. When we're looking at our application, which is in the ocean between south of Massachusetts to

57
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:22.589
Daniel Kuchma: you know Virginia, it's. Our area is really defined about where there is going to be this 120 billion dollars investment in offshore wind energy.

58
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.890
Daniel Kuchma: And so we think, actually, we have a really nicely defined region.

59
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:37.319
Daniel Kuchma: and as well. What it describes is, you need. These partnership stakeholders is driven by applications, etc. And when we read through what this Nsf

60
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:48.739
Daniel Kuchma: proposal was asking for we said, hey, it's really nice, in fact, actually wrote something specific for what is really needed in the area of offshore wind energy. So that was our impression. One

61
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.280
Daniel Kuchma: where did nsf get this idea from? maybe not. But

62
00:07:53.430 --> 00:08:04.740
Daniel Kuchma: mit.

63
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:14.450
Daniel Kuchma: And so when you read what Nsf. Is doing, I think they're saying, Wow! You know Europe really succeeded this way. Nsf. Wants to pay a much larger role in this space.

64
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:24.129
Daniel Kuchma: One of the 5 areas that the horizon program has invested in is healthy oceans, and therefore that's why in Europe they are at the forefront in many areas. One

65
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.790
Daniel Kuchma: so, Kevin, I will turn it over to you.

66
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.600
Kevin Oye: thank you, Dad. So the Us. Is at a really critical moment.

67
00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:38.080
Kevin Oye: Wind energy is the central to meeting the climate. Carbon reduction goals that the Us. Has said.

68
00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:44.379
Kevin Oye: and with that 120 billion dollars that Dan mentioned of offshore wind development over the next 10 years.

69
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.100
Kevin Oye: what we'd be putting out into the water is 30 gigawatts of power.

70
00:08:48.450 --> 00:09:00.859
Kevin Oye: but that faces both technical and environmental, and community challenges, as many of you know, on this call who've worked in it. There's been a technical challenges, but they're also an environmental challenges as well as community challenges.

71
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:18.209
Kevin Oye: and the Us. Is behind the rest of the world with wind energy deployments Today there's only 7 turbines off the coast of the Us. Compared to the over 3,000 in the EU, and if you look at the who, the suppliers are, the majority of the suppliers, and then the majority of developers are European.

72
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.179
Kevin Oye: and China today has the fastest pace of deployments of all show in.

73
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:43.639
Kevin Oye: So the complexity, though, is high, the complexity and number of stakeholders have to be involved in these kinds of deployments is really really significant. It's not just the local community thing. It also becomes a state thing, a Federal thing. It's a across energy boundaries. It's across marine ecology, boundaries. It's very complex.

74
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.510
Kevin Oye: and in order to get it right.

75
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.129
Kevin Oye: you really need all the stakeholders at the table.

76
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.159
Kevin Oye: and that's what motion can do.

77
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:59.370
Kevin Oye: We can really fill that gap? We can bring together the stakeholders across all those dimensions. So they can co-create

78
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:12.429
Kevin Oye: what we believe is the infrastructure you need going for in the future that produces the clean energy we need, but also protects and enhances our marine ecologies, our marine industries, and also innovates whole new blue tech.

79
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:29.230
Kevin Oye: So we think that very bringing together these kinds of stakeholders, we can actually drive nature inclusive designs. We can strengthen our understandings of the ring ecologies in ways that improve our data set collection through new sensors to new algorithms for actually modeling that

80
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:37.170
Kevin Oye: that can also then create the data. You need to really make data-driven policy decisions, and most important of all.

81
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:43.710
Kevin Oye: by involving directly the coastal communities who are most impacted by these wind offshore wind developments

82
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:50.779
Kevin Oye: we can actually tap their wisdom, their expertise, their understanding, their lived experiences around these challenges

83
00:10:50.960 --> 00:11:01.479
Kevin Oye: and have them help us co-create the innovative new blue technologies, the new fisheries, all the new industries that can take advantage of us getting this right.

84
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:21.880
Kevin Oye: The time is now. I mean the fact that we're at the beginning of our deployment. It makes it perfect for us to step in. Now set the tone set to pace, set the template in the models, because this is what's going to serve as the model for the rest of the deployments across the United States on both coast, and it could serve as a New World model.

85
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:34.579
Kevin Oye: And so for us it's an opportunity not just for our region, not just for our country, but it also can help address the issues around us competitors worldwide around these technologies and these deployments next slide.

86
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:51.089
Kevin Oye: So, as many of you know, on this call, there's all kinds of work that has been done to date around the research to indicate that you can actually do designs in the water that actually enhance them. Reading ecologies, you can click next one. This is a series of bills.

87
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:58.559
Kevin Oye: Yeah. So so clearly as Dad mentioned earlier, you put you, you put structures in the water you can get. You can actually foster grows next one.

88
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:08.579
Kevin Oye: And clearly you can actually create artificial reefs. There's work that's been done by people on this call and trying to create artificial reefs that actually help preserve things. Next.

89
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:23.579
Kevin Oye: you can click through to the end of this one. clearly, Europe understands this. That's why they're funding it. And I think people in the offshore wind industry now understand that there's an opportunity here that if they want to deploy wind energy, United States in particular

90
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:36.610
Kevin Oye: doing it in a nature inclusive way. It works not only for them, but also for the benefit of the environment and for the support of the public for offshore wind, so it really becomes a a win-win proposition for all.

91
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:53.510
Kevin Oye: Now, having said that, as all of you wouldn't call now, there's a lot of work to still be done, really the tip of the iceberg of understanding all these issues. But we once again believe that motion can bring those resources to there, and we can collectively then share those results to drive, change

92
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.389
Kevin Oye: my wind energy next slide.

93
00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:14.079
Kevin Oye: and it's clear that reef issues is something that's been well identified. We're losing them significantly, but the opportunity to help preserve those reefs and actually restore and grow them by making wise choices about what we put in the water is an opportunity for motion. Next slide, please.

94
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:32.789
Kevin Oye: I I saw. Add on this call from Inspire. I mean, this slide came from inspire. but clearly there's an opportunity here, as we put the wind infrastructure into place, to actually make choices and materials in geometries, and in the way we deploy it to actually enhance and the rain environment next slide, please.

95
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.150
Kevin Oye: So

96
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:43.640
Kevin Oye: our region is unique in the sense that we defined it around our common goals needs and opportunities, and not by our geography.

97
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:56.280
Kevin Oye: It's interesting today. All the wind deployments that are going on out there are really going project by projects state by state, and we may be missing an opportunity to really collectively think about how to do this

98
00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:06.939
Kevin Oye: and that's what motion strives to do. So what defines our region is that we are all in this region, deploying wind energy over the next 10 years as part of that 120 billion dollars, 30 gigawatts.

99
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:28.629
Kevin Oye: And, more importantly, we all share the same challenges for doing that. We all share the same issues around trying to do it in a way that's opt more for long-term economic value. We also share the same challenges with developing our coastal communities, many of which which sit in areas that the Economic Development Authority defines as being deprived.

100
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:44.070
Kevin Oye: You'll notice that on this chart here that if you look in the areas where the wind deployments are occurring, they are often adjacent to areas which are considered deprived. And so, for example, what's interesting to look on is chart is that many of these coastal areas

101
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.760
Kevin Oye: are very close to metro regions which are considered innovation capitals of the world.

102
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.350
Kevin Oye: So, for example, New Bedford is only 70 miles from Boston.

103
00:14:52.500 --> 00:15:03.420
Kevin Oye: but the contrast is stark. you would find in New Bedford that the population there. The average gross income is only 34,000. That's 2 thirds of what it is for the State.

104
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:16.259
Kevin Oye: and the unemployment rate is actually 40% higher than the rest of the State. John Mitchell, the mayor of New Bedford, describes the town as being a a city of strong shoulders.

105
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:27.479
Kevin Oye: But what he would like to see is new Pepper become a city, a strong brains, you know, indicating he wants to lift up the economy, not just by increasing jobs, but increasing the skill level of the jobs.

106
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:48.010
Kevin Oye: and that creates an opportunity for motion. If we put in these regions incubation, innovation incubators that bring together people with a local wisdom and a wisdom and understanding of those environments with researchers and state researchers and technologies and entrepreneurs who want to help store the part and make good things happen.

107
00:15:48.040 --> 00:16:04.670
Kevin Oye: We can create the environment where they can co-create, identify, and co-create those new blue economies and new ways of doing things that are not only improve the way in which we deploy the offshore wind energy, but also potentially create a whole new economies, whole new blue tech economies.

108
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:14.790
Kevin Oye: and that opportunity for us to do that will not only lift regions like New Bedford, but it creates a model, then that we can share across the region and Cookie Cutter into other places.

109
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:22.150
Kevin Oye: So the power of speaking with one voice as a region also gives us tremendous leverage with policy

110
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:40.660
Kevin Oye: as speaking with one voice that's data driven. We can help influence wise choices and policy and deployments in contract size and contract design, and, as many of you know, by looking at things in a long economic cycle, for example, we may be able to influence the way in which the infrastructure that's put in place

111
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.370
Kevin Oye: not only has a long life to it, but also then it's more nature

112
00:16:44.590 --> 00:17:02.309
Kevin Oye: major inclusive. So for all these reasons we actually selected these regions for our first conversion projects, then to be those places where they already have some infrastructure or community support in place, that we can very quickly move from the early

113
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:02.960
Yep.

114
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:15.639
Kevin Oye: Early sizing phases to being able to. Then quickly, in the later in the third and fourth year of the engine grants be able to actually go to deployment. But that will set the model up then for future conversion projects.

115
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.560
Kevin Oye: So I think for us. We have an opportunity.

116
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:23.029
Kevin Oye: By speaking with one voice driven by data.

117
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.220
Kevin Oye: we can be more effective.

118
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:35.799
Kevin Oye: and by leverage our research and experiences across the region we can lift all boats we can create and help all new communities, and by working together

119
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.920
Kevin Oye: we can put

120
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.399
Kevin Oye: in motion a brighter future. I can resist the pun.

121
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:49.069
Kevin Oye: so we'd love to get your feedback and comments on the summary. There's a more expensive form of it in the writing. But

122
00:17:51.930 --> 00:18:01.739
Daniel Kuchma: so thank you very much, Kevin, and I know there's someone who joined with an area code 401. I was trying to go through to see if I could mute, because I think there's a little bit of background noise.

123
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:08.130
Daniel Kuchma: I've not been monitoring the chat because i'm sharing my screen. So.

124
00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:15.069
Daniel Kuchma: Kevin, if you look at chat, you may see that there's some questions relevant. But why you're looking at that.

125
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:22.120
Daniel Kuchma: We'd invite anyone who has a comment about the vision that they have seen expressed whether or not this resonates with them.

126
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:42.170
Daniel Kuchma: Where do you see that we're not going down the correct pathway? There's going to be multiple other opportunities as well for discussion. So we only put a couple or a few minutes in right now at this point. So if there was a short question or something you want to make a comment on until we continue, and then there's more time later for discussion. We'd be happy to take a couple of minutes for that.

127
00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:59.469
Kevin Oye: Yeah, Mike. No, thank you for the clarification that that definitely yeah, we have to be careful that we're we're not, you know, overstating what we can do. I think the the key message is really it's an opportunity for us to make sure. We minimize and hopefully do things that enhance. But clearly we're not going to

128
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.970
softball issues.

129
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:20.279
Daniel Kuchma: since we're not seeing other comments just the way most sometimes these events can go. What I'm going to do is i'm going to move on, recognizing that there'll be more to the discuss once. People have, in fact, actually seen more.

130
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.020
Daniel Kuchma: so

131
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:33.839
Daniel Kuchma: what i'm going to do is I'm going to talk a little bit about how we view the team and the approach to the structure of motion, which is what we've named our innovative engine.

132
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:41.619
Daniel Kuchma: And so the theme, of of course, of what we're focused on is, we want to have healthy oceans. We want to grow the blue economy.

133
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:52.960
Daniel Kuchma: and we feel there's a huge opportunity to do this through nature inclusive offshore wind energy farms, because in our region there's this likely 120 billion dollars of investment

134
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:58.470
Daniel Kuchma: development costs over what will be the 10 years of the Nsf. Support for this engine

135
00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:15.179
Daniel Kuchma: to do these things. Of course you need to engage with a broad, different types of groups. and it's a particularly complicated area, which also very much aligns with the scope of what Nsf. Is looking to advance

136
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:33.409
Daniel Kuchma: because you really need to to bring industry to the table. Be those offshore wind developers. Blue tech startups be those unions, and I know Chris Bashant, I think, is on the call from Carpenters local 326 in Connecticut, for example.

137
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:51.190
Daniel Kuchma: You need to have responsible bodies, so those can be regulators like Baum that could be like the doer, or deep down in Connecticut, as it comes to looking at, actually procuring. And what do they actually consider? These are the groups that define lease lengths, define environmental requirements.

138
00:20:51.420 --> 00:21:03.970
Daniel Kuchma: We care, of course, about what the act is on the stakeholder communities, because the reality is that if the environmental community and the people who make other use of the water fisheries and aqua culture.

139
00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:17.819
Daniel Kuchma: If If things are not done that are a net positive benefit, then this industry is probably not going to go and grow to the scale, that it really would, could, and it, which is very important to address climate change concerns.

140
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:31.999
Daniel Kuchma: But as well. The scale of the investment is this huge new economic opportunity for addressing inequities in society, etc. So we need to have experts at the table in doing this, and the educational community as well from K. To gray

141
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:40.200
Daniel Kuchma: and that includes outreach like even what is happening in the New England Aquarium is one of the core partners as how to we engage people more broadly.

142
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.050
Daniel Kuchma: The

143
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:55.750
Daniel Kuchma: this image here is the one that describes how we have structured things, so i'll give you a sense of what these 3 vertical lines are, and then we're going to talk about the individual aspects of them, one after the other.

144
00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:56.910
Daniel Kuchma: so

145
00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:08.960
Daniel Kuchma: as mentioned. Nsf. this is a 10 year funding. But the plan is by the When you get to the in 10 years you have the relationships and and other sources of investment that it can exist for decades to come.

146
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:16.319
Daniel Kuchma: we have working group areas, and this is what we're going, really inviting those people on the call to

147
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:24.760
Daniel Kuchma: after this meeting, Say, hey, we'd happy to participate in a working group, and then we will send you information about what that's going to be about.

148
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:43.049
Daniel Kuchma: We have 4 sort of characters of working groups: the top one here nature inclusive offshore wind farms. A lot of this is more focused on the engineering aspects. What are the specific things we're putting in the water, and for what purpose are they? Good? Structurally, Are they good from a standpoint of marine, gross

149
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:59.959
Daniel Kuchma: and habitats for the ocean. Science is just trying to understand the ocean much better than we presently do in the impact of what we put there on again those marine growth and habitats. So there's an engineering aspect of it, and there is very much of a core marine science aspect of that.

150
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:18.889
Daniel Kuchma: It's a blue economy, of course, blue tech as well as how we're going to have shared use of these oceans in the future, and looking at what new types of opportunities will be because climate is already changing a number of things for people in these communities there's already conflicts between fisheries and aquaculture.

151
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:32.300
Daniel Kuchma: we want to engage with people in those conversations, and we'll talk about the mechanisms for doing so, so that we can look at how we make net positive benefits for the environment and communities, and finally, education, outreach and training 250.

152
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:48.660
Daniel Kuchma: and so these are the different working groups that are going to be discussing, looking at various questions and making plans for the future, and that future primarily being what is done in years. 3 through 10 of the engine and beyond

153
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:55.709
Daniel Kuchma: Nsf is providing the monies for the first 2 years of the engine.

154
00:23:55.950 --> 00:24:12.340
Daniel Kuchma: and we have these 5 what we call convergent projects. What is a convergent project? It means it's not siloed in one particular area, but it's actually drawing from a number of different era disciplines, areas of expertise and different communities.

155
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:27.640
Daniel Kuchma: and we're going to have one person from each of these groups describe what those are about, but do consider them to be these 2 year. projects multidisciplinary. You actually have deliverables coming from them.

156
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:41.660
Daniel Kuchma: And then this is the engine infrastructure that the League organization is primarily responsible for that knits everything together. and does the support of the working groups as well as to the convergent projects.

157
00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:47.750
Daniel Kuchma: And how we're actually going to operate the working groups. We're not going to try and reinvent any wheels here.

158
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:59.429
Daniel Kuchma: There are already great organizations that have done things such as bring together the offshore wind industry as well as the communities that are current users of the ocean space.

159
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:10.439
Daniel Kuchma: They've been meeting for a long time. They've been developing helpful documents, and they have built these trusted relationships between communities and the industry.

160
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:21.399
Daniel Kuchma: So people who are core partners of the team like the responsible offshore Science Alliance, what they are going to do in their in their working groups that they already have is they're going to add to it

161
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:32.120
Daniel Kuchma: some of the missions Of what the engine is about, and so they will expand. There'll probably be some new committees. There might be some new memberships, but we're going to build from what

162
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.540
Daniel Kuchma: already exists

163
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.559
Daniel Kuchma: similar to that. And Nick, are you on the call?

164
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.410
Nick Napoli: I am?

165
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:59.030
Daniel Kuchma: Do you want to say a a little bit about? Because I think you know the response on the regional wildlife. Science collaborative has very similar, but different as well, and in terms of what Rosa is doing. So, if you would take a couple of minutes to describe what Rwsc. Does. That would be great.

166
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:12.200
Nick Napoli: Sure. Thanks, Dan. Hi, everyone. I'm Nick Napoli I'm. The executive director for the northeast Regional Ocean Council. We are the co-host of the regional wildlife science collaborative for offshore wind, and also host the northeast ocean data portal

167
00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:30.290
Nick Napoli: and we've already got. As as Dan said, we have an existing structure, many of you, on on this call established this group to have an existing structure where we can identify priorities for research, wildlife research related to offshore wind and collaborate on

168
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:45.460
Nick Napoli: implementing those priorities, and then, of course, use the northeast social data portal to disseminate data. So as you can see on the the far right of the slide. That is the subcommittee and caucus structure that exists within. Rwsc. there's already one

169
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:58.280
Nick Napoli: groups meeting almost monthly to to coordinate data collection and monitoring for for for wildlife science related to offshore wind. You know many of these groups. It's a a lot of the expertise.

170
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:14.600
Nick Napoli: It it within the region in terms of any one of these taxa and of course, through the the the ard we see is managed by the Federal agencies, the States, the offshore wind industry and and the Ngo caucus. So

171
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:23.659
Nick Napoli: it's a it's an existing structure that has been developed over the last several years. just for this type of of coordination around data collection.

172
00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.909
Daniel Kuchma: Thank you very much. I'm: Nick.

173
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:43.889
Daniel Kuchma: And as soon as we get through this this description of the research team, and this structure we will have a period of time where we can ask questions. So questions, for example, on about our Rwsc. And their mission. There's opportunity At that point

174
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:45.960
Daniel Kuchma: a mark. Are you on the call?

175
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:59.169
Daniel Kuchma: hey? Mark so we have the a slide describing some of the work that see a head does on the screen.

176
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:05.759
Daniel Kuchma: Would you be like to provide an introduction to what see a heads mission is, and who you work with.

177
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:11.719
Daniel Kuchma: and the relevancy, as you see it as it pertains to this engine, because see ahead is one of our core partners.

178
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.599
Daniel Kuchma: So please go ahead. You're muted at the moment.

179
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:45.470
Daniel Kuchma: Okay, I think we lost connection there. to mark. So what I'm going to do is i'm actually going to go to the next slide, and then, if mark you join back on. Then we'll return to this slide, because I think it'd be nice to have it right for you. So there we are. I'm back. Sorry I was trying to get off mute. so so see ahead

180
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:58.689
SeaAhead: we run we we! That was the first dedicated ocean incubator for startups, called boost. Well in partnership with the doing the quorum. It's we're not third cohort that is operating out of Cambridge.

181
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:09.729
SeaAhead: we're also in our pilot cohort for an accelerator blue tech accelerator with University of the Mississippi down in the Gulf Coast, also the first of its kind in that part of the country.

182
00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.510
SeaAhead: If none of these startups have funding, it's all moot

183
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.879
SeaAhead: it's still a really relatively

184
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.670
SeaAhead: not well understood

185
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:39.000
SeaAhead: sector in the investment community. So we hate. We started the Blue Angels group which done a lot of early stage investments until the Navy tells us we can't say blue angels anymore. That's what we call it. And we're also raising a fine, so we can move faster and write some bigger checks to the to the companies that are scaling, and and the big picture is

186
00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.870
SeaAhead: We overlap with climate, tech circle, economy, clean tech

187
00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.260
SeaAhead: life, science.

188
00:29:46.310 --> 00:30:03.889
SeaAhead: and and food and Ag, but the difference, with all of our sister sustainability. Groups, so to speak, is that the ocean is not an afterthought. We take a nose-centric approach, and we go out. This makes our universe actually very large. We can. We've even looked at, let's say, nitrates with data analytics

189
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.890
SeaAhead: out in the in the farming communities because it goes out to see eventually

190
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.659
SeaAhead: and lastly, i'd say the the the mission and the vision of see a head is that

191
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:25.609
SeaAhead: we need a bridge to to what the STEM-based venture community, so called, go out to see, and that's. Why, we have the incubator and the accelerator in the early days investments. We think that's the real gap.

192
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:36.280
SeaAhead: Once we can strengthen that capacity-building part of the so-called value chain. We'll see a lot more entrepreneurship tied to the ocean, like you see, in clean tech or food in that, like or circular economy.

193
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:55.959
Daniel Kuchma: Okay, Dan, is it perfect? Mark? And so see ahead is going to Co. Convene the activities of working group 3 with e for all as well. I'm not sure if anybody from E for all is on the call. If so, it'd be nice to just say hello and say a word or 2 about your organization.

194
00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:06.510
Jeremiah Hernandez, EforAll: I didn't know their neighbors. It's Jeremiah Hernandez I'm, here with E for all we're based in Lowell, Massachusetts. We have 12 sites throughout the Us.

195
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:25.480
Jeremiah Hernandez, EforAll: and a few along our eastern seaboard south coast being one of them. we are accelerating economic and social impact through inclusive entrepreneurship. And we think we can be of value to this partnership

196
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:41.140
Jeremiah Hernandez, EforAll: in you know, exposing underrepresented entrepreneurs to the work that that we're all we're all planning on making happen. So thanks for having me. And if you have any questions, I'm. Jeremiah at e for all.org

197
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.400
Daniel Kuchma: Thanks, Jeremiah.

198
00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:53.290
Daniel Kuchma: So that gives you an impression about some of how some of these working groups are going to operate, and who's going to lead them? And what sort of the scope is

199
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.890
Daniel Kuchma: in terms of what are the

200
00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:13.609
Daniel Kuchma: Mit. Ctl. And so we're bringing together a large community. Right? So you have different stakeholders. You have regulators, you have researchers. You probably have some people in Europe who have been working in a number of areas together. We said, a core mission of the working groups is to plan what to do in years, 3 to 1,250.

201
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:30.819
Daniel Kuchma: So these working groups are really starting to think about. Well, what are the big questions? Maybe not questions that we can answer with one little small research project. But what are the big questions that we need broad engagement for, and in some cases significant new investments, some of which can come from Nsf.

202
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:37.340
Daniel Kuchma: But some might actually come through, for example, joint industry projects. And if you look at the European horizons program

203
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:53.469
Daniel Kuchma: as well as other things in the area of the offshore wind industry. There has been an incredible number. If you're extremely well funded and very effective joint industry projects. So the working groups are going to think about and tackle some of these quest. Difficult questions.

204
00:32:53.500 --> 00:33:07.240
Daniel Kuchma: and I've put some examples here on this screen. Right? So what should be the optimal design life for foundations, what public data is needed on properties, what monitoring strategies should we use? How well do we really understand the health of

205
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:23.210
Daniel Kuchma: marine ecosystems. Number 5. There is something that there is a a huge amount of debate on, you know, in Europe, and also in the United States. If you're putting things in the water, are you trying to maximize biodiversity? Are you just trying to re-establish what used to be there 250.

206
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:27.480
Daniel Kuchma: And how do we actually know which is the more effective strategy, etc.

207
00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.230
Daniel Kuchma: So

208
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:34.159
Daniel Kuchma: the working groups are going to identify questions, Think about, prioritize them

209
00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:47.079
Daniel Kuchma: mit ctl. And what can we do in the short-term media term in long-term where the cases where we need joint industry projects, or to actually achieve this we're going to have to have substantial public-private partnerships and other things come to be 100 and

210
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.339
Daniel Kuchma: So this gives you a flavor of what the working groups are about.

211
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:57.180
Daniel Kuchma: and then I want to talk about what the engine infrastructure is that is, connecting

212
00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:03.230
Daniel Kuchma: the work that is supporting the working groups it's supporting the convergent projects.

213
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:08.499
Daniel Kuchma: I'm. Going to start this by telling you why we call ourselves motion.

214
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.779
Daniel Kuchma: So it's because our mission is the ocean.

215
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:17.690
Daniel Kuchma: And so we very much like the particular term, because it's pronounced like the word

216
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:30.110
Daniel Kuchma: motion, and of course not for wind farms. There is significant motion everywhere, so it's the wind, it's the blades, it's the fish, it's the boats, it's the workers, and it's also the conditions that change over time.

217
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:45.100
Daniel Kuchma: Josh has a wonderful little video where he will be illustrating that because our benefit conditions we're developing reefs, our waters, chemistry, stratifications, etc. All this changes as a function. Of time. And so it's this motion for wind energy development.

218
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:59.250
Daniel Kuchma: that is not something that is as dominant a concern as it is on onshore. So we figure it's a nice term and characterization. We also like the term because this is an Nsf. Engines program.

219
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:15.470
Daniel Kuchma: And so what is motion while motion puts physical, human financial resources in motion. And this is really the fuel for the engine that, in conjunction with Nsf. Investments and from other communities can really do something that drives this just energy transition

220
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:20.379
Daniel Kuchma: and takes advantage of what the scale of the investment will be in this space.

221
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:29.880
Daniel Kuchma: we're going to talk a little bit about the our Deia plan later on. data models and tools are probably a little bit self descriptive.

222
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:40.729
Daniel Kuchma: but we are at a very nascent state. When it comes to what we have collected in terms of the needed. It needed data to actually create the models or tune the models.

223
00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:45.930
Daniel Kuchma: There are intellectual property issues in the sense that even what is collected

224
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:59.169
Daniel Kuchma: by wind energy developers, let's say, does not get completely shared. There's a lot of activities about that over the world, and it remains that remains a significant challenge that we hope this engine can contribute to as well

225
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:13.469
Daniel Kuchma: mit ctl. And and so if you have data and you're developing models ultimately, if you're doing, use-inspired innovation it's about creating the types of tools that will be helpful to decision makers, and so this will be discussed as well briefly mentioned in some of the convergent projects, 150.

226
00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.690
Daniel Kuchma: what is societal cost of energy.

227
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:27.469
Daniel Kuchma: I'll use a little graphic to illustrate this. And so when we think about what the actual cost is for getting electricity by a certain particular source.

228
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:32.930
Daniel Kuchma: and these are you know, dollars per I should say euros per megawatt hour.

229
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:39.129
Daniel Kuchma: The decisions usually right now are made entirely about what is the levelized cost of energy.

230
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.470
Daniel Kuchma: That is the cost of design.

231
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:50.519
Daniel Kuchma: construction, installation, operation, and decommissioning at the end typically on a 25 year time horizon.

232
00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:54.580
Daniel Kuchma: But if you want to really consider what the end. This is the dominant.

233
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.960
Daniel Kuchma: what is used for selecting which developers win projects, etc.

234
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:13.270
Daniel Kuchma: What you really want to do is you really want to consider other impacts? And so that pertains to what is the benefit on local employments? What is the benefit to the environment, and also what the potential costs are along that line.

235
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:20.499
Daniel Kuchma: People have been talking about this for a while, but it's not really a very data-informed approach to

236
00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:27.429
Daniel Kuchma: so Umass Dartmouth has been doing quite a bit of work in this space, and they are one of our core team members as well.

237
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:34.260
Daniel Kuchma: But if you look at when we start to consider some of these other impacts, and i'll just focus on the one for offshore wind.

238
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.659
Daniel Kuchma: and this is from a little bit while ago. So this was $95 a megawatt hour.

239
00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:49.999
Daniel Kuchma: When you actually look at what the various costs are for subsidies being received, which is not. This is European. So there's really at that stage the game they've exhausted them.

240
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:56.110
Daniel Kuchma: There's a transmission cost. There's a variability cost that you need to consider right. That's a storage effect.

241
00:37:56.350 --> 00:38:05.399
Daniel Kuchma: so you have a levelized cost which considers these systems effects. But then you have some other things that you want to consider such as what is the benefit to employment.

242
00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:17.450
Daniel Kuchma: An offshore wind is one of those areas, for example, where there's huge opportunities for benefits to employment. But there's a bunch of other things that are not obviously included here, but are things that we want to consider in our engine.

243
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:32.780
Daniel Kuchma: Ultimately, if you have data, models and tools, and we have an improved way of considering what all the various impacts are of the technology that we've selected to use to generate our electricity, such as jobs and environmental effects.

244
00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:40.569
Daniel Kuchma: Then the policies and decision-makers are in a better position to do things, so maybe a little bit differently than they did in the past.

245
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:54.570
Daniel Kuchma: And so, for an example, right now is most dates key driving parameters, a levelized cost of energy in the Netherlands. The chief driving parameter right now in the selection of a wind energy project is environmental impact one.

246
00:38:55.050 --> 00:39:05.079
Daniel Kuchma: So but you need the data in order to be comfortable doing that, you know. We would love for an example for a decision. What would be one of the things we've been chatting a lot with the industry about is.

247
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:11.169
Daniel Kuchma: hey? What would happen if Suddenly Balm said that the leases were for 60 years rather than 25 years.

248
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:30.749
Daniel Kuchma: How would that change? What we do, and the answer to that. Well, it would change everything. but you know, is balm in a position to be able to do that. Is there enough knowledge, data to really know whether or not that would be the right thing to do? No. So that's one of the things that the engine wants to support as well to help people make other types of decisions when appropriate.

249
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:40.639
Daniel Kuchma: So, and according to the schedule, we have about 7Â min at this stage the game to respond to questions and comments you have may have

250
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:58.209
Daniel Kuchma: about the structure of how we've organized motion in terms of the functionality of the working groups. We're going to talk about the convergent projects next. But questions and comments about the working group as well as the engine infrastructure that we're providing would be most helpful

251
00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:07.060
Daniel Kuchma: through. Chat is also very helpful. So happy to listen to your Take a few minutes here and listen to some of your questions

252
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:12.540
Daniel Kuchma: or comments.

253
00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:26.000
Daniel Kuchma: or you can decide. You know we'll wait a little bit and learn a little bit more, and then we'll have all our questions at the end. We wanted to at least insert a couple of time blocks earlier on.

254
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:32.890
Daniel Kuchma: so that if there were particularly other types of questions, we could respond to them. Chris, I see you raised your hand.

255
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:38.250
Chris Swan: Yes, thank you, Dan, appreciate the opportunity to hear all this.

256
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:46.649
Chris Swan: I I had a question much earlier you talked about how the overall structure of this Nsf engine would be flexible.

257
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:55.210
Chris Swan: and I wanted to know what that meant. What did it mean? Flexible in terms of directions or projects, or

258
00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:09.379
Chris Swan: the overall scheme of things are being done. But could it also mean that it could be become even more inclusive. No, if you find other partners, you find others that can be included. So I just wanted to get a feel for what that direction may be.

259
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:10.330
Chris Swan: Thanks.

260
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:28.440
Daniel Kuchma: Chris terrific question. And Nsf. Has actually, for this engines program had a number of these various webinars a multi hour. Webinar Webinars, where people had the opportunity to ask questions, and there was a number of questions to them. You know. What do you mean when you say it needs to be nimble and flexible 150.

261
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:31.879
Daniel Kuchma: And the answer is that

262
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.660
Daniel Kuchma: I don't think they really necessarily know

263
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:42.269
Daniel Kuchma: that what they did use was they used the Life Sciences example from the National Science Foundation

264
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.679
Daniel Kuchma: and sorry, but that was just

265
00:41:46.010 --> 00:42:05.939
Daniel Kuchma: Oh, I see. Sorry Someone was just sending Farrah was just sending me a a note, so I had to look at it for a sec. But anyhow, the Matt State of Massachusetts invested over a 1 billion dollars in fostering the advancement of life sciences, and they actually had the person who leads that organization.

266
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:15.020
Daniel Kuchma: give a presentation to everybody who had submitted these Nsf proposals. And when you look at what the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center did.

267
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:23.729
Daniel Kuchma: It was doing everything under the sun. It was sponsoring schools, small little projects here and there it was, changing direction significantly as they learn.

268
00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:43.069
Daniel Kuchma: Nsf looked at that model and said, Man, this would really be just a fantastic thing for us to be able to do in these use inspired research where we're trying to drive economic development. We know it's not like a traditional Nsf. Center. A traditional Nsf center is. You have your core group of partners that essentially remains fixed.

269
00:42:43.080 --> 00:43:00.049
Daniel Kuchma: You develop this multi-year re research strategy. And then you execute it according to that plan, modifying it, as you learn, but it doesn't change all that much. What they wanted in this case is for you to be able to bring on a lot. New partners have joint industry projects 150,

270
00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:13.060
Daniel Kuchma: and do things that were are not really like anything that Nsf. Has funded it in this space in the past. Yes, Nsf. Has done it. These small Sbi R. Grants, etc., but nothing of this type of grandiose scale. One

271
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:25.509
Daniel Kuchma: one of the questions and concerns that was raised in a that is because of Federal requirements. Are you really set up to be able to have an organization? Be this nimble and still compliant

272
00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:44.029
Daniel Kuchma: with the various types of Federal requirements. So I think Nsf. Knows what they want to achieve. They know they want it to be nimble and flexible, but they don't know what that means, and so it's to us to do what we think is the best in terms of creating a let that level of nimbleness.

273
00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:50.409
Daniel Kuchma: and at the very end of the slide deck I am going to talk about the sustainability of the center

274
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:56.970
Daniel Kuchma: and our vision for a spin up organization that starts as the same year as the Nsf. Supported engine

275
00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:09.569
Daniel Kuchma: mit ctl, and that is able to attract and manage other types of joint funding and interests, in order to achieve the level of flexibility that we think is suitable for the nature of the industry, and what motion is trying to accomplish 150.

276
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.539
Daniel Kuchma: That makes sense.

277
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:21.100
Chris Swan: Yes, thank you. Really great. More sounds a little bit more entrepreneurial than just stagnant. So appreciate it.

278
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:30.070
Daniel Kuchma: Absolutely. Yeah. And it's new. It's very new space. Farrah, Are you back on? I know I saw your note. Okay.

279
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:41.530
Daniel Kuchma: at least for a minute. So at least for a minute. So while so while you're on, let's let's go ahead. And so we're going to move to the next topic in the conversation. It's the same slight to start off with.

280
00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.149
Daniel Kuchma: And so, Farrah, please pick it up from here.

281
00:44:44.900 --> 00:45:03.110
Fara Courtney: Okay, thanks. Dan. i'm going to talk a little bit about use inspired research, and basically what we're going to be doing. And for the first couple of years and these research projects are going to be the fuel for the discussion, tangible fuel for the discussion within the working groups.

282
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.129
Fara Courtney: and a way to get the engine up and running very quickly.

283
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:12.679
Fara Courtney: So this suite of projects was developed to test, drive

284
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:20.550
Fara Courtney: all the the multiple overall concepts of the engine, and so collectively, they're designed to do a couple of things

285
00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:27.860
Fara Courtney: create touch points for applied research throughout the region. So to start creating that regional identity

286
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.529
Fara Courtney: and connectivity

287
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:39.680
Fara Courtney: and doing so in specific locations and in partnership with specific industrial sectors that are targeted for positive economic impact

288
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:41.000
Fara Courtney: within the engine.

289
00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:48.170
Fara Courtney: they're designed to develop baseline information at both the micro scale

290
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:53.779
Fara Courtney: in terms of what's happening in with these new structures in the ocean.

291
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:57.310
Fara Courtney: in order to inform how we can channel that

292
00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:05.890
Fara Courtney: better channel; that the development of new ecosystems, new reefs in directions that we find beneficial

293
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:17.890
Fara Courtney: and to prototype, and to do that at the micro scale, but also at the macro scale, looking at big data and looking at these individual structures collectively.

294
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:23.539
Fara Courtney: And this is one thing that we feel that the the engine is really

295
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:27.389
Fara Courtney: poised to make a great contribution to the industry, since

296
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:44.340
Fara Courtney: currently we need to look at projects only project by project through a regulatory process. Now that we're at scale looking at those larger interactions and looking at this infrastructure system in that context is really important. We have projects that are starting

297
00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:48.340
Fara Courtney: a that's starting to look at in that dimension.

298
00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.470
Fara Courtney: and also to prototype

299
00:46:52.730 --> 00:47:08.250
Fara Courtney: mit ctl and economic development innovative economic development partnership and outreach strategies within communities. So we're going to be hearing about these these discrete projects in a minute. But it's important to remember that through this overall structure of the engine 150.

300
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:18.220
Fara Courtney: These projects will be feeding each other. They'll be interacting, and they'll be identifying synergies and crosstalk information

301
00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:25.650
Fara Courtney: through this structure in order to inform, as everyone said, the subsequent years of the engine.

302
00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.660
Fara Courtney: So with that i'll turn it over to

303
00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:32.159
Fara Courtney: who is running

304
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.200
Fara Courtney: managing the first conversion project.

305
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:43.840
Colleen Hansel: Great Thank you, Farrah. Hi! Everyone i'm calling Hansel i'm a senior scientist that with whole oceanographic institution

306
00:47:44.150 --> 00:48:01.599
Colleen Hansel: on Cape Cod and Massachusetts, and i'll be speaking for the Cp. One team. So Kevin already gave a really nice introduction to nature inclusive design. What the benefits are, what the needs are to effectively enable this within offshore wind.

307
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:13.740
Colleen Hansel: So in this 2 year convergent project, what we want to do, and the goal is to to begin narrowing down. What type of material modifications can we do to optimize this approach?

308
00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:21.880
Colleen Hansel: as well as begin just laying the foundation for being able to bring in parallel ecosystem services such as Cb. Aquaculture.

309
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:30.499
Colleen Hansel: So we're going to start off by doing small scale deployments that will ultimately be upscaled for testing in the emergent phase.

310
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:43.729
Colleen Hansel: So you know some of the first order questions that we have are, you know, what are the chemical and biological modifications that should be done to increase the both the recruitment and the growth of target benefit species.

311
00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:53.409
Colleen Hansel: what are corrosion? Protection systems? have a dual benefit of iting corrosion as well as providing an optimal benefit community.

312
00:48:53.810 --> 00:49:10.949
Colleen Hansel: And then what you know, kind of physical modifications can be done to the structures to increase ecosystem diversity, while also increasing design life. And so some ideas of what those questions are and what they look like, or in the illustrations on on in images on the right hand side.

313
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:22.789
Colleen Hansel: But I want to focus in right now on our objectives, which are, we have 3 dominant objectives for this first project in the first 2 years. So one is, you know, we need to identify optimal

314
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:42.240
Colleen Hansel: materials. Co. corrosion control geometric modifications and deployment approaches that we want to use for the small scale testing incorporating this nature inclusive design. So to do this, what we really want to do is benefit from what's already known. We want to hold the workshop in that first quarter, bringing in all the working groups.

315
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:49.979
Colleen Hansel: bringing it outside partners, and and really, you know, not reinventing the wheel, but but learning from what we already know, and then it looking to advance that

316
00:49:50.300 --> 00:50:07.079
Colleen Hansel: So that'll be the starting point from what comes out of that workshop. And in those discussions we want to then construct and deploy materials, increasing and complexity throughout the 2 years. that will begin to test some of these chemical, biological, and material modifications. And so.

317
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:20.639
Colleen Hansel: for instance, we want to test an array of chemical compositions within concrete and steel as well as surface coding that will increase recruitment a target species. We want to see those materials with target species, and so on

318
00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:36.080
Colleen Hansel: later on in the in the 2 year project. We want to then bring in some physical modifications, using nature inclusive design strategies. in the geometric design in small prototypes that we will put out within the field in deployments.

319
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.329
Colleen Hansel: throughout later in that second year.

320
00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:53.989
Colleen Hansel: and then overall Throughout that. the 2 years we will continually be monitoring these structures trying to learn from You know how these modifications are impacting the the communities, the diversity, the growth.

321
00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:17.730
Colleen Hansel: the by the local biogeochemistry, as well as just ecosystem productivity, will be using both available at institute sensors and sensing technologies and platforms that we can put out as well as keeping an eye on what types of other sensing needs do we have in the future for monitoring and for identifying key parameters for feeding into models.

322
00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:21.499
Colleen Hansel: And then all the while we'll also be monitoring the structures

323
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:30.059
Colleen Hansel: for corrosion and bio deterioration. So I think my 3 months is probably up. So i'm happy to take any questions at some point

324
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:46.820
Daniel Kuchma: next project is about nature inclusive concrete gravity-based foundations. About 75 of installations right now are large steel monopiles

325
00:51:46.830 --> 00:52:03.849
Daniel Kuchma: Some people have concerns about those for a variety of reasons. one is that you typically drive them, and the noise associated with the driving can be have a on a not a great effect on habitats. People are working at new technologies to and actually reduce that which is fantastic.

326
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:10.219
Daniel Kuchma: concrete has an advantage, for if you use concrete gravity, base, you floated out and sync it. So you avoid the noise.

327
00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:24.109
Daniel Kuchma: the the elements that though we're going to focus on in this project is really looking at and why we care about concrete is the increased durability that is provided by it.

328
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:34.909
Daniel Kuchma: what type of effect can it have on local jobs? And we recently did a report on this. We want to explore concrete solutions because they are a little bit easier. Let's say to future proof.

329
00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:50.479
Daniel Kuchma: and what I mean by that is, when you have a concrete foundation, the cost increase potentially to build this so that it can take a 20 megawatt turbine down the line. If it starts with life with a 15 megawatt turbine

330
00:52:50.490 --> 00:53:09.899
Daniel Kuchma: is not necessarily all of that large relative to other foundation solution options. So we can start to think about much longer design lives with, I think, in a more economic way, with the use of concrete than with the use of some other structures which are deteriorate more rapidly, and are more sensitive to fatigue and other issues.

331
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:22.690
Daniel Kuchma: Another thing we like about concrete that we went to explore is, since you can play with the mineral characterization in the surface condition of concrete very effectively, that gives opportunities for some

332
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:36.179
Daniel Kuchma: mit ctl, and to better tailor it for marine growth, and then that then leads to certain habitats. So what are we going to do? We're going to look at comparing designs for concrete and steel structures for different med ocean conditions, Different locations, 250

333
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:46.669
Daniel Kuchma: we're going to look at, due to physical and geo-technical issues address bearing and lateral load capacities. We'll have to understand the met ocean conditions for doing this work 2,

334
00:53:46.680 --> 00:54:06.389
Daniel Kuchma: and we're going to do optimization for the concrete. And then we're going to do a lot of comparisons now of the costs and benefits of concrete versus the steel monopyle structures, as it pertains to cost differential life's, considering life cycle costs and the possibility of these much longer. design lives

335
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:22.379
Daniel Kuchma: and so that's what we're primarily going to do. We know that one of the things this is going to lead to. If we're thinking about concrete gravity based structures actually having providing a significant component of the foundation systems

336
00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:40.669
Daniel Kuchma: is for that to be possible, because there's other challenges in terms of length of time to construction. We don't have necessarily the fabrication yards. Sometimes there are dredging issues, so we're going to have to identify the policies, the incentives, the investments, public private partnerships, are, in fact, actually needed

337
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:51.729
Daniel Kuchma: to drive this forward. So we've been working with groups who very much care and want to pursue this solution. i'll show this one image down here. So my Phd was on

338
00:54:51.740 --> 00:55:02.810
Daniel Kuchma: concrete gravity-based oil and gas structures, so I had the opportunity to be out in the field during construction of these structures, for which the first year of inspection is 30 years down the line.

339
00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:17.629
Daniel Kuchma: because you can really, if you do it properly, make concrete structures to last a very long time, Aaron or Chris, would you like to just say something for a minute about some of the jay technical items that one cares about when they're thinking about the use of concrete gravity bases.

340
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:26.629
Aaron Bradshaw: Sure, thanks, Dan, this is this is Aaron Bradshaw. I'm. A Geo. Technical Engineering professor at the University of Rhode Island.

341
00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:32.910
Aaron Bradshaw: both in the civil engineering and ocean engineering departments, and my colleague, Chris Baxter, is also on the call

342
00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:45.600
Aaron Bradshaw: really are going to be are going to provide a supporting role in the geo-technical engineering of to help support Dan and his team with the the development of these gbs concepts so is with regard to Gbs.

343
00:55:45.740 --> 00:56:05.309
Aaron Bradshaw: you know, there are things. it's important to look at things like stability of the soil as well as deformation of the soil, because those will actually influence the the geometry, or the configuration of the action, or the size of the of the actual platform. So what we hope to do is is to do some analysis.

344
00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:15.099
Aaron Bradshaw: not audio technical analysis, not only to support the installation. So you have to think about what are the things you have to think about about the soil when you install it.

345
00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:34.210
Aaron Bradshaw: as well as when it's in service. What are the what are the issues, stability, and deformation that you have to think about when it's actually operating. so we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna sort of provide that analysis to provide realistic, really realistic constraints for Dan and his team so that they can. They can design and look at realistic sizes and things for the

346
00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.959
Aaron Bradshaw: for the the gravity based structure.

347
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:38.430
Daniel Kuchma: Thank you very much, Erin

348
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:40.359
Daniel Kuchma: Josh over to you.

349
00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:55.320
Josh Kohut: Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone. My name is Josh. Cohut. I'm at Rutgers University, and very excited to bring with you the or introduced you. The ideas behind this third convergent project which we're calling the new Blue Fisheries economy.

350
00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:11.790
Josh Kohut: the term new blue economy has been thrown around, and a lot of people may have different definitions. The definition that we're going through are going to use as we develop this idea. is that it's an economy centered on the utilization of new large data sets and models. So

351
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:24.500
Josh Kohut: these data sets are expanding. We all know, in different parts of the met ocean space, but also the fisheries, the ecology, the economy, all of these different data sets can be better utilized with some innovation.

352
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:37.730
Josh Kohut: and applying research to make sure that that data can actually be drilled down to inform policy and decision making. So how do we go from information to decisions. And the focus here is to help

353
00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:56.039
Josh Kohut: use that data to help transition the fisheries communities in the region to a productive and sustained coexistence with planned offshore. Wind. And the way we're going to do that is we're going to leverage existing ecological fisheries, data sets and coexistent

354
00:57:56.050 --> 00:58:10.129
Josh Kohut: oceanographic and atmospheric models to co-develop with those stakeholders, dynamic fisheries, habitat projections, and those projections are focused on supporting, as I said earlier, the transition of

355
00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:22.780
Josh Kohut: a new blue fisheries economy which which we're arguing is a is a way for those fisheries to sustainably coexist with offshore wind the map and diagram on the upper right kind of shows where

356
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:40.590
Josh Kohut: we can take all of these different data sets, combine them, and if we do it in an innovative way. we can develop these dynamic habitat models. We're going to do something a little differently here, I think, than has been done in the past is that we are engaging other communities, including the in the

357
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:55.479
Josh Kohut: industrial engineering and artificial intelligence community, so can we build artificial intelligence frameworks that will allow us to more effectively merge these different data and models to build tools that are specific to a need.

358
00:58:55.490 --> 00:59:11.319
Josh Kohut: and so that's our general plan. With this convergent project objective 3 shows that in the first 2 years we're going to focus that effort on 2 main products. the first is recognizing that there will be shellfish fishing displacement.

359
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:29.739
Josh Kohut: That displacement can be mitigated, and has already been suggesting. There are discussions on mitigating that by potentially making other similar habitats productive and become fishing targets for those different fisheries. And so we'll use these dynamic tools to identify

360
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:33.630
Josh Kohut: potential suitable locations for that and then the second

361
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:39.799
Josh Kohut: topic will be looking at dynamic, thin fish habitat. We're going to focus on squid because they're short-lived.

362
00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:54.240
Josh Kohut: We're also going to incorporate the actual wind farms in those models, so we can understand the impact of wind farms on those dynamic models, and I show an example of one model there that's moving around. We recognize that the ocean moves.

363
00:59:54.250 --> 01:00:04.689
Josh Kohut: Fish have fins, so they move, and we can actually utilize all these data sets to build tools that capture that and capture in a way that decision makers can actually use it.

364
01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.330
Daniel Kuchma: Josh: Thank you ever so much.

365
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.259
Daniel Kuchma: So over to you, Annie.

366
01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:17.060
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): great, Thank you. good morning, everyone. I'm I'm Annie Murphy. I'm at inspire environmental

367
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:25.849
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): and I'll be talking about convergent Project 4 which inspire myself and others here.

368
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:29.100
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): Our collaborating with, several

369
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:41.659
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): researchers at Hampton University, Deirdre, Gibson, and Joey Reesley, as well as Jeanette Davis. and see ahead. So mark Wong and our project is really

370
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:51.479
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): there's sort of 3 prongs that kind of align with the entire Nsf. Engine. where we're interested in looking at

371
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.660
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): who's growing on the monopiles?

372
01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.049
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): and

373
01:00:56.270 --> 01:01:02.220
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): what is structuring that growth? So what's structuring and and and

374
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:16.779
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): you know, controlling or what are the factors that are really important and understanding? Who's there, and what they're doing? because we know that the organisms that colonize these structures are.

375
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:27.199
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): you know, really important in the ecosystem and the ecology of the system. So understanding who's there? And then that's sort of objective one.

376
01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.789
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): you know. Fundamental

377
01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.700
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): ecology questions.

378
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:32.339
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): and

379
01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:39.160
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): this project is really going to be based at at sea, Val, or the the 2 research monopiles are already built

380
01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:41.770
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): objective t 2

381
01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:56.019
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): we'll be exploring emerging technologies that may be used to monitor shifts in the benthic community that are living there. so we'll be exploring a DNA 100

382
01:01:56.030 --> 01:02:07.129
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): as well as the use of stereo imagery. and and the data we can we can obtain from that imagery. and in emerging other emerging technologies.

383
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:14.559
Annie Murphy (INSPIRE): and finally I i'll turn it over to Jeanette to talk about objective. 3, Jeanette, are you there?

384
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:21.539
Jeanette Davis: Yes, I'm here. Good morning, Everyone and Happy New Year. I'm. Janette Davis.

385
01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:33.020
Jeanette Davis: I am an adjunct professor at Hampt University and founder of sciences everywhere, Llc. Which is essentially created to for safe spaces, for people of color and marginalized groups to explore

386
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:51.589
Jeanette Davis: a science. And so for objective. 3. I heard a lot of you talk about inclusive projects, and we know that in order for projects to be inclusive, that's really making sure that people feel included. And so objective. 3 Willie is around inclusivity of students.

387
01:02:51.600 --> 01:03:02.489
Jeanette Davis: and creating training and workshop opportunities for them as well as host organizations. And so we really want to take time to develop tailored workshops

388
01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:19.739
Jeanette Davis: that specifically focuses on De Ij, not only for the students, but again for the host organization, so that we ensure that students are going into welcoming environments that foster the E. I. J. And with that i'll take any questions if if there are any.

389
01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:35.400
Daniel Kuchma: Thank you very much, Jeanette, and what we'll do is we got a few more slides, and then we're going to actually have a good chunk of time for some questions and discussion. We know a number of them have come up in the chat, which are absolutely terrific, and we'll have a little bit of time in just a bit to get to that.

390
01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:37.800
Daniel Kuchma: so over to you, Bob.

391
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:57.020
Bob Chen: Thank you, Dan. The the idea of convergent Project 5 is a lot of overlap and the pilot testing for the Education Outreach training group. And we're collaborating with newing an aquarium Bristol community College, and a whole host of existing educational networks across the region in the nation.

392
01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:28.179
Bob Chen: we are aiming at to future offshore wind ports, New Bedford and Salem as these pilot projects in the first 2 years, and we would like to scale that across the region at other coastal communities offshore port impacted communities through 3 years, 3 through 10. But we're again piloting these things in a in a real way with community, so that we can scale up in in the outer years. task one is is using outreach strategies and doing an aquarium there with their X

393
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:41.289
Bob Chen: and exhibits interactive websites, social media to engage and expose a very diverse public audience. through all of these activities. for

394
01:04:41.410 --> 01:05:00.540
Bob Chen: engaging people in seeing that nature inclusive. Offshore wind is a good thing, we I finding support, engaging, finding that their careers, and in in in this area One of the very practical things we're going to do is is form 3 hands on educational activities. Co-develop them with teachers

395
01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:08.599
Bob Chen: implement test them and disseminate them. We have a great deal of experience. through cozy centers for ocean science, education, excellence funded by

396
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:38.580
Bob Chen: Nsf the best of hands on activity, has been distributed to 10,000 oceanographers across the world. over the last project there. Some examples of this very use inspired nature in inclusive offshore wind. How do we design an ocean bottom structure to support biodiversity? And this could be it at the elementary level? It can be also, altered to be at the college level or public. hands on experience type thing measuring energy produced by scaled models of an offshore wind

397
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:53.189
Bob Chen: turbine. They can see it, they can test it. They can measure things and mapping a diverse coast of community, get support and benefit offshore wind. So what is the impacts on a spatial sort of context. So the just 3 examples. But we have to co-develop these with with with educators.

398
01:05:53.200 --> 01:06:09.879
Bob Chen: we are gonna work with 2. The port communities with their youth to do needs assessment project job growth and map educational training programs and and then have that report and those results shared with the community and government leaders as again a model of

399
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:23.389
Bob Chen: it's really hard to say no to your youth, and you are not as constrained as adults. We have a lot of experience actually, with this in environmental areas people we listen to the youth actually more than they do to the the adults. and

400
01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:48.819
Bob Chen: We want to listen to the community. And so a Community Advisory Council made up of those youth and some teachers, formal, informal educators and community organizations that we can listen carefully to when we need what they what they want. So as we develop the research questions as we develop the educational programs. We are engaging the community at the very beginning. So, Kathy, you are you on? Do you have anything to add to this one.

401
01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.509
Kathayoon Khalil, Ph.D.: Yes, i'm here. Hi, Bob, Sorry

402
01:06:52.750 --> 01:07:12.579
Kathayoon Khalil, Ph.D.: and Hi! Everyone my name is Kathy and Khalil. I am the Vice President of Conservation, learning at the New England Aquarium and we were really excited to partner on this project. This reflects a lot of our current direction and strategic priorities, including youth development and a focus on teens and young adults in

403
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:23.299
Kathayoon Khalil, Ph.D.: climate and ocean issues. So the community needs assessment is something that lies very firmly within our guiding principles and and strategic priorities.

404
01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:35.149
Kathayoon Khalil, Ph.D.: for exactly the reasons, Bob said that we don't want to move forward with any of this work without first hearing from the from the users and then groups as we're doing so much of here in the broader scope of this project. So.

405
01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.389
Kathayoon Khalil, Ph.D.: so I to say that.

406
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:47.289
Kathayoon Khalil, Ph.D.: we're very interested in seeing how this can integrate with other work that we're doing at the aquarium, so it's not a standalone project, but instead, integrated and woven into

407
01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:56.510
Kathayoon Khalil, Ph.D.: the broader scheme of our learning framework which would benefit not only the project and the aquarium, but also all of the users involved.

408
01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:59.330
Bob Chen: Thank you so much, Kathy. Next slide, dan

409
01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:28.169
Bob Chen: i'll i'll mention that us Boston is a minority-serving institution, and has been rated the third most diverse student population in the country. we're very excited about a win-win-win solution in the workforce development area. we think that nature inclusive design with offshore wind energy solves these problems. If we do it right, we can increase or enhance marine ecosystems. We can increase and enhance the communities

410
01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:40.889
Bob Chen: better air quality in these coastal communities better public services job opportunities in within and staying within the community. and a clean energy transition.

411
01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:58.090
Bob Chen: Here's a a table that Dan put together thinking about what is the benefit of one per gigawatt of of energy. So something like 67 turbines if you have a a a particular cost per kilowatt hour it generates something like

412
01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:27.940
Bob Chen: point 3 9 billion dollars, which, if you takes a very a nice salary and benefits 150 K. Create something like 2,500 jobs. And and so if you scale up to what the engine is looking at. 30 gigawatts that's something like 78,000 jobs, and those are direct jobs paid for by the energy. So we think of a times 3 multiplier if we think about supply chain and supportive services and community impacts and sort of all that. biden's thinking about 110

413
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:57.940
Bob Chen: gigawatts by 2,050 or the next 30 years. that's 300,000 jobs and times 3 is close to a 1 million jobs. If you think that's crazy, Netherlands is our is is game in at 70 gigawatts. So why is the Us. Just slightly sort of higher? And if we fill up a 15% demand of energy, 300 gigawatts that's 750 k in in just a very high paying jobs. within the direct field, and the indirect is again a multiplier. The workforce development challenges and opportunity

414
01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:03.660
Bob Chen: are very exciting, and also challenging new educational programs, hybrid, remote.

415
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:31.429
Bob Chen: low barrier, engaging micro credentialing, etc., at high school level, community, college level university level, Co. Generated with industry to be nimble and service serving the workforce development as well as the the industry in a whole host of different kinds of of jobs as you can see here. we know that this is a complex system and transdisciplinary system. Level thinkers are needed and will be built into the curriculum and the programs, and the introduction of sort of all that stuff

416
01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:58.619
Bob Chen: and energy you saw from the introductory materials. And and we this new blue economy about a new fishing and aquacultural practices, and the way that we do things, and the co-location with offshore wind, I think, produces a lot of very exciting educational practices across the world, and all of this will be a pilot sort of piloting in the first 2 years to feed that education, outreach and training workshop. We set the the the scale, and we scale across the region as well as the country.

417
01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:04.790
Bob Chen: so I turn it back to oh, for Kerry, for the diversity edge! equity and inclusion. slide.

418
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:11.760
Bob Chen: Gary, are you there?

419
01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.359
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): I am. Thanks so much, Bob. Can you hear me?

420
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.139
Daniel Kuchma: Yes.

421
01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:42.069
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): perfect, perfect. Hi! Everyone Kerry will can speak yell here. I'm a faculty member emails Boston and the Director of radical investment and strategic solutions towards equity rise consulting Llc. so i'm gonna talk a little bit about our model here that we are taking as part of the motion engine. I'll talk about the image on the right first, and then i'll talk about the text on the left.

422
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:46.569
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): so as you've heard as we know, talked through, that the presentation thus far

423
01:11:46.580 --> 01:12:15.440
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): there's really this synergistic relationship right at the core between motion and the communities that we're engaged in right. The communities that we're embedded in Kevin talked earlier about being really really immersed in New Bedford thinking about communities that I've historically been echo economically marginalized as a franchise. How are we doing? Use informed science, use inspired science, that is informed by these communities right? We're listening to these communities.

424
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:32.350
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): and then we turn, we're disseminating our findings, really ensuring that the work that we're doing goes back into these communities so that then they can, you know, work towards advancement. So really thinking about this by directional reciprocal, that's at the core of what's taking place with motion.

425
01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:35.750
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): listening to, and being connected with our communities

426
01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:49.880
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): off to the left, right, really thinking about how motion through workshops, through training, are increasing, the equity focused mindset of our stakeholders and our partners right When we think about. You know, environment.

427
01:12:49.890 --> 01:13:12.829
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): equity, focused mindset throughout the partners and the stakeholders that's in turn going to benefit the communities that we're engaged in. Right. We can take a more culturally responsive approach. We're listening to. We're working alongside, working with communities versus extracting right and not necessarily returning our findings back to these communities.

428
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:32.209
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): So I think there is this cultural responsiveness, this equity Focus mindset that in turn influences our workforce development. So you've heard Jeanette speak. You've heard Bob talk about really working with K. Through 12 working with University level students really ensuring that we're increasing access.

429
01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:53.120
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): Our pipeline of ocean scientists and marine scientists will consistently look the way it currently looks if we're not thinking strategically about the communities that we're investing in and ensuring that we're improving inclusion and access right, making sure that we're broadly diverse workforce through ocean science.

430
01:13:53.130 --> 01:14:04.449
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): And when we do that right, those individuals and go back to their communities and incorporate transformative and innovative contributions in communities that have been historically understood.

431
01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:14.379
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): So we're taking this kind of a framework right, this multi-pronged framework of engaging the community center, and communities that have been historically underserved.

432
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:24.509
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): We really ensure them that we're advancing offshore when ensuring that we're advancing ocean science. And the next generation looks quite differently than it does currently.

433
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.749
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): So how are we going to do this?

434
01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:51.219
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): Throughout the model? We have multiple partners, as we've heard, discuss, and we're taking a distributed model. Right? So instead of this one person being the spokesperson of, did across our 50 partners, we're thinking that our multiple partners have individuals who are doing this work on the ground already. And so let's listen. Let's leverage that's really, you know, Expand those partnerships and what's currently being done.

435
01:14:51.230 --> 01:15:11.030
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): So it's going to be integrated throughout the engine from the leadership of the decision making processes all the way throughout. We'll have our multiple partners where we're ensuring that we're meeting regularly, and the strategies that we're coming up with that center equity. Inform the working groups inform the convergent partners

436
01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:16.329
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): so really making sure that did is dispersed throughout the empty model.

437
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:29.029
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): Right? We're adopting an advancing, promising practices. Folks right. When we know that things are working, let's expand it. Let's set it up, let's support it, and let's ensure that now it's been utilized throughout the engine.

438
01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:46.429
Kerrie Wilkins-Yel, PhD (she\her): and of course, right. We're doing this work when we're centering smart right objectives of strategic, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time bound. so yeah, I think that's kind of where we're going. We're thinking about the did work, and it's connection, especially to workforce development.

439
01:15:48.980 --> 01:16:08.880
Daniel Kuchma: Carrie. Bob, Everybody else. Thank you ever so much for those really great presentations, and we're sort of primarily going to switch into a discussion. Mode I think I have one other slide that we want to make sure that we definitely show before we finish today. but before having a discussion on what you've just heard in the convergent projects, etc.

440
01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:12.139
Daniel Kuchma: I want to share a tool.

441
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:15.269
Daniel Kuchma: and so let me see here, I kind of get to chat.

442
01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.650
Daniel Kuchma: there it is there.

443
01:16:17.850 --> 01:16:18.910
Daniel Kuchma: So

444
01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:23.039
Daniel Kuchma: we are. We'll share this afterwards.

445
01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:23.969
Daniel Kuchma: But

446
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:29.449
Daniel Kuchma: what it is is we've created something for people to use

447
01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:44.840
Daniel Kuchma: in order to be able to provide us comments. And so, hey, someone people are already using the jam board that's fantastic cheryl. So maybe I can describe it. And, Cheryl, please correct me when I make mistakes. So we're going to leave this thing open for a week.

448
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:56.470
Daniel Kuchma: just for you folks to go through, and you know, identify what you see as things that are good, bad areas of improvement, etc. And so there's several different

449
01:16:56.590 --> 01:17:01.260
Daniel Kuchma: boards that you can simply toggle through if you go to that link.

450
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:07.820
Daniel Kuchma: And the way you do it is when you're on a page. If you got something you want to add, you go over here.

451
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:10.090
Daniel Kuchma: You grab yourself a sticky note.

452
01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:23.709
Daniel Kuchma: There is a index down here. If your academia, industry, government, or other gravely associated color, whatever you happen to be, i'm academia, so I will grab Green

453
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:38.719
Daniel Kuchma: and what convergent projects will be useful to consider right. You can go through and add something to it. So, that's the process for actually going through and using the mechanism, and we'll provide some instructions after this as well.

454
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:43.129
Daniel Kuchma: we're going to field a couple of questions now that have come up.

455
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:59.549
Daniel Kuchma: but and then we're going to the team is going to stay on at 1130 to be able to continue this. So let's Farah has pointed me out that there was a question about concrete gravity bases. And what about the cement.

456
01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:16.760
Daniel Kuchma: because isn't spent a really bad thing or is in concrete a really bad thing. Absolutely. It's 6 to 8 of the global Co. 2 emissions are from cement. We manufacture 4.4 billion tons of cement every year. About half of that is produced in China. That's why their footprint is so large.

457
01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:21.920
Daniel Kuchma: but the amount of cement we actually use in these concrete gravity bases is very small.

458
01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:34.430
Daniel Kuchma: The way that the industry looks at Co. 2 footprint of generating electricity from different sources is that's expressed as grams of Co. 2 equivalent per kilowatt of generated electricity

459
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:40.500
Daniel Kuchma: for a concrete gravity. Base it would contribute one gram per kilowatt hour.

460
01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:48.050
Daniel Kuchma: If you're generating electricity from call it's 820, if it's from gas, it averages around 490

461
01:18:48.080 --> 01:19:05.200
Daniel Kuchma: overall franch or wind and offshore wind. It's typically around the order of 12 or so grams per kilowatt hour. That's why, when you go from coal generating electricity to using wind or solar to generate electricity, you end up. That's why we make our use. Carb. Co. 2 savings.

462
01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:18.240
Daniel Kuchma: so of that 12 grams or so for offshore wind. You have a but of gram of it that would be related to the cement. So yes, men, is an enormous problem globally, but from the amount we use is so small that it's

463
01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:35.989
Daniel Kuchma: negligible relative to the savings. If concrete enables us to do some things that otherwise our benefit to the economy. longevity of our wind farms, etc. So I've answered that question and ferret. Do you want to flag and take another one. I think we have maybe

464
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.340
Daniel Kuchma: 4Â min, 5Â min, and then i'll move to some closure and discussion of next steps.

465
01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:50.799
Fara Courtney: Okay, great just let me know when you when it's time for the last question. we have a good one here for Convergence Project Number 3

466
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:57.780
Fara Courtney: can considerations be included of using wind farms as marine reserves as part of Cp: 3.

467
01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:06.339
Josh Kohut: Yeah, I'm. Here so our thought process with with Cp. 3 is that by building this

468
01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:21.479
Josh Kohut: framework for using the data and the AI to bring all this together and build tools that there's opportunity for future tool development. As the as the engine progresses through the 10 year timeframe, and what we had to do is come up with 2.

469
01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:35.850
Josh Kohut: What we felt was 2 things that we could do in the first 2 years to demonstrate the utility of this approach and have some early success. And so the 2 focus areas initially are only intended for those first 2 years. So

470
01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:50.040
Josh Kohut: you know, in answer to the question, there's certainly opportunity to use this approach and framework, and certainly the partnerships that'll be developed by the engine to do other product development. As the engine progresses from years 8, you know, 3 to 8 or 3 to 10.

471
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:56.300
Fara Courtney: Okay, let's see

472
01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:03.990
Fara Courtney: Another question: is there a place to see the objectives for each convergent project group

473
01:21:04.170 --> 01:21:07.809
Fara Courtney: their hypotheses and their metrics for success?

474
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:15.830
Fara Courtney: And so.

475
01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:18.719
Daniel Kuchma: Tara, were you going to ask someone to field that question.

476
01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:28.999
Fara Courtney: Well, I wanted to see if there's anyone that want to jump in, but I would say that they will. There will be more. There will be some detail in within the proposal.

477
01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:32.610
Fara Courtney: but that those refinements will be developed

478
01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:36.999
Fara Courtney: Once the project is once we're actually

479
01:21:37.170 --> 01:21:40.870
Fara Courtney: getting ready to launch the project. That's that's my understanding.

480
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:47.320
Fara Courtney: Anybody else. Have a comment on that.

481
01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:59.560
Bob Chen: Everything you saw on the slides will be in that draft proposal. the metrics are being included in evaluation plan, which will also be part of that proposal. Some detail, but not all of them too

482
01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:01.000
Fara Courtney: right.

483
01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.000
Thanks.

484
01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:08.559
Josh Kohut: I was just gonna add. It's hard in the constraints that Nsf. Puts on any proposal and page to put all the details. But

485
01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:16.399
Josh Kohut: our intention with Cp. 3 is that when we do that code development process, if funded, we would be able to define those metrics.

486
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:26.270
Fara Courtney: Thanks. I'm. I'm. Looking for additional questions. I see a lot of great comments

487
01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:33.309
Fara Courtney: does any. If anyone has a question that's come to top of mind, feel free to

488
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.329
Fara Courtney: call it out

489
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.069
Fara Courtney: as I look through the chat.

490
01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:55.160
Daniel Kuchma: and far, maybe i'll say one thing, and then we'll go to the next slide. But it, Jamie, if you're on, can you comment whether or not. Actually, one can design things very explicitly to try and develop certain types of marine growth and habitats. If you're on the call.

491
01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:59.009
Daniel Kuchma: be interesting to learn from your experience if you're on still.

492
01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:10.100
Jamie Lescinski: Yeah, hey, Dan? so from our experience. so we come from like a very engineering background. Let me just preface this by saying that.

493
01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:14.859
Jamie Lescinski: that we're a marine construction company.

494
01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:22.339
Jamie Lescinski: and we have a very strong engineering background, and we have a strong marine Bio group and environmental group

495
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:40.780
Jamie Lescinski: within within our organization and for our nature inclusive design elements and for our habitat development. elements that we've designed, produced and installed is so far what we see is that we have an increasing level of success

496
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:46.300
Jamie Lescinski: at being able to design for particular species or types of habitats.

497
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:53.930
Jamie Lescinski: It's never perfect, but it's a bit of trial and error, and we're also gaining understanding.

498
01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:56.579
Jamie Lescinski: And how the material.

499
01:23:56.610 --> 01:24:10.769
Jamie Lescinski: Influences this for particular types of marine environments, and how certain environments are just much more tolerant of particular material. Substrates and others are, and they're more focused on 150

500
01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:30.329
Jamie Lescinski: basically 3 dimensionality, like certain macro microstructures. And that's different for other environments where they really the substrate is incredibly important. and what you put in there. So we're yeah, we're having some good good successes and a lot of learning over the last, basically like 10 years with this

501
01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:38.820
Jamie Lescinski: and our pilot projects that we've had now between Europe and the Americas. mostly, and a little bit in Asia.

502
01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:43.120
Daniel Kuchma: Jamie. Thank you ever so much, and the one of the

503
01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:45.380
Daniel Kuchma: whereas you use are really like learning.

504
01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:59.959
Daniel Kuchma: we have to find mechanisms in order to learn. And if you're when you talk to Europeans who've been working in this space, and you know, since you're from Boscalus right? So. you both call us has been involved in the offshore industry a long time, and has a very large market share.

505
01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:16.670
Daniel Kuchma: But it's people regret that they haven't, done the types of things that actually allow us to learn right, and that's data model tools. And so so much about the way this engine has been structured is, how do we maximize the learning we can do because we got to put these things out. We got to try. We got to see what happens.

506
01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:33.480
Daniel Kuchma: because until we do that and we demonstrate it. We can't do nature inclusive design at the scale, and with the level of reliability that we want to be able to. That would be possible if we're able to advance and test. So that is a key function of the engine. So this will be my last slide.

507
01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:49.890
Daniel Kuchma: One of the things that nsf talks about a great deal in these engines programs is they don't want to launch something, and it dies right away. So I was involved in 2 previous Nsf. Centers, which pretty much closed door. the day after the funding stopped. But

508
01:25:50.050 --> 01:25:59.620
Daniel Kuchma: this is a very different in environment that we are looking here. We are seeing an expecting exponential growth in this industry over decades to come.

509
01:25:59.850 --> 01:26:14.080
Daniel Kuchma: The need is there, for you know, addressing climate change and the opportunity for transforming communities, etc., in a very positive way and through new opportunities is tremendous. I put this on the screen as one example of the money that is in the system.

510
01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:25.959
Daniel Kuchma: And so in the recent auction. While somewhat recent auction, I guess at this stage of the game in New York, where they auctioned off an area of the seabed, which is about 25 by 25 miles. If you add it all together.

511
01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:39.040
Daniel Kuchma: The summation of the bids just to have that lease area to be able to develop in the future. You don't have a project, no agreement, but just the right to be able to use that space, for, let's say, 25 years of operation. After a project is awarded.

512
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:52.349
Daniel Kuchma: The industry paid 4.3 7 billion dollars just for the opportunity. Have a little bit of the seabed for doing this. there's these names of these companies. You don't know who are these? Really.

513
01:26:52.360 --> 01:27:01.280
Daniel Kuchma: They're mostly international oil and gas companies. So it's you know it's what what used to be stato on now. Equin, or it's British petroleum. It's hotel.

514
01:27:01.290 --> 01:27:21.209
Daniel Kuchma: it's it's it's shell. It's a a lot of the big players. the very last. Most of the so. Most of them are European. This very last group. Here is one of the new Us. Developers on to the scene. The other one is Dominion down in Virginia related to the project that, and he spoke about so our view

515
01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:36.700
Daniel Kuchma: and sort of as a little bit of a closing comment, even though the rest of us are going to stay on just to continue to respond to questions, for as long as people want to look at this. we see there's lots of opportunities to do the types of things that we think really needed to be done in the engine.

516
01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:41.599
Daniel Kuchma: And one of the terms we used a lot in the last little bit is this term responsibility.

517
01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:57.030
Daniel Kuchma: So the industry, you know, they're fighting and very competitive process to, in fact, actually be able to deliver projects, deliver projects on time. They can advance Nature Inclusive design approaches with all these other benefits all by themselves.

518
01:27:57.150 --> 01:28:00.680
Daniel Kuchma: our responsible bodies. such as you know.

519
01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:14.329
Daniel Kuchma: Those who engage in procuring or managing and regulating offshore wind energy. We're still new to this game, right? We got 7 turbines in the water, as Kevin mentioned. They can't do it by themselves.

520
01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:32.190
Daniel Kuchma: But as that big oval ring I showed much earlier on it actually takes an entire community to be able to think about and do this right. And so we believe that we've assembled through our 18 partner institutions on this proposal, and if we're successful, we hope that the people that will be brought into that

521
01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:40.520
Daniel Kuchma: that with that brings already established relationships such as Rosa and Rwsc. And others already have. We can

522
01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:43.179
Daniel Kuchma: take a responsibility

523
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:47.760
Daniel Kuchma: for thinking about what are the best things to be doing in this space for

524
01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:55.829
Daniel Kuchma: benefiting society. So you know, we think we are doing a lot of things here which is really very much aligned with exactly what the Nsf

525
01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:57.279
Daniel Kuchma: program is about.

526
01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:07.749
Daniel Kuchma: They may or may not see it that way. The inner sub processes of all very interesting and subject to what an individual reviewer sees and what questions they raise. I've been in a lot of panels.

527
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:21.699
Daniel Kuchma: but we would like to think that motion, this entity that we've created in these relationships, that if we're not success with the Nsf. engine in this round, that we will find mechanisms to be able to make significant advancement.

528
01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:30.269
Daniel Kuchma: So that we can have responsible large-scale offshore wind energy that brings the types of benefits that we recognize our nation very much lead needs.

529
01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:38.210
Daniel Kuchma: So that's sort of the conclusion of things. And so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

530
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:40.630
Daniel Kuchma: stop sharing my screen.

531
01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:49.129
Daniel Kuchma: and if you want to see everybody, you can go up to the top right hand corner and go into Gallery View. That's often very helpful.

532
01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:51.400
Daniel Kuchma: And

533
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:53.269
Daniel Kuchma: The team is going to stay on.

534
01:29:54.040 --> 01:30:01.810
Daniel Kuchma: We're going to provide. You have the link to jamboard. We really appreciate using jam board. We're going to share the proposal

535
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.840
Daniel Kuchma: very much. Appreciate your comments. Fairly High Level will provide some instructions.

536
01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:15.789
Daniel Kuchma: There will be office hours at a few times next week, so if people have additional questions and comments. We look forward to receiving them from you.

537
01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:30.870
Daniel Kuchma: So now is the time for sort of open discussion. We can use hand raising, as maybe a first way to kick this off, and we'll see how long people want to go for.

538
01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:36.040
Daniel Kuchma: So when I see a hand i'll call on you.

539
01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:53.479
Daniel Kuchma: So i'm not seeing any hands.

540
01:30:55.400 --> 01:31:09.510
Jamie Lescinski: I'm gonna ask Who's Who's gonna hey, Jamie? Thank you. I'm going to ask some questions. Sorry I couldn't find the hand in zoom. I'm: pretty zoom incompetent teams, professional. but

541
01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:17.660
Jamie Lescinski: yeah, so I was interested. So basically there is like this: this 2 year initial, 2 year element, and then it continues there after and

542
01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:20.830
Jamie Lescinski: looking at a lot of the initiatives and also thinking about

543
01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:37.070
Jamie Lescinski: You're the what you are stressing that they, the intention of Nsf. Is to create something that has a strong enough foundation and impact that becomes rooted and grows there after it becomes sustaining in essence, self sustaining self growing.

544
01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:44.540
Jamie Lescinski: And so I was thinking about Josh, about your comment on the the model development and the tool development.

545
01:31:44.730 --> 01:31:52.029
Jamie Lescinski: and I was wondering if it's part of the more grander intentions that like to use this initial 2 years

546
01:31:52.050 --> 01:31:58.340
Jamie Lescinski: for a lot of like the the concept and the tool developments like initial piloting on a

547
01:31:58.380 --> 01:31:59.340
Jamie Lescinski: on a

548
01:31:59.570 --> 01:32:19.350
Jamie Lescinski: a smaller scale, I think calling. This goes also with like what you're talking about with materials and elements. But then really focusing on or having a key element of like that next 2 years where it's really about the application stage like. So there's like a possibility over the course of like this whole program to actually have those iterative cycles

549
01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.800
Jamie Lescinski: where you go through like concept development.

550
01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:26.690
Jamie Lescinski: implementation or like testing

551
01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:28.450
Jamie Lescinski: application.

552
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:38.419
Jamie Lescinski: learning because it's not going to be perfect, or it might even you fail. Redesign or redevelop, re calibrate, whatever it may be.

553
01:32:38.690 --> 01:32:39.469
Jamie Lescinski: Test

554
01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:53.500
Jamie Lescinski: like, keep going to like. I have a few of those cycles. So you kind of like, yeah, you end up like reaching all of your stakeholders along that pathway. So it is. Yeah, it's just kind of wondering about your thoughts and the thoughts of the the various team leaders

555
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:59.200
Jamie Lescinski: about how they see that to like. Get that embedded, and that that application and testing component.

556
01:33:00.150 --> 01:33:05.350
Josh Kohut: you know I I I could say I think it's a really good thought. There, Jamie, and and our

557
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:21.849
Josh Kohut: our approach, as I I mentioned, was to say, there the innovation here is bringing together community that haven't been brought together. There are those that are familiar in the data. Those are familiar on the fishery, those that are familiar with AI and some other. These tools, these data tools that can be used.

558
01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:35.940
Josh Kohut: but they haven't talked much in in the past. We've been trying to do it sort of AD hoc, I think, as a community, and so this opportunity allows us to be much more rigorous. Get the right people together from communities that Haven't talked before and

559
01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:53.270
Josh Kohut: when thinking about how we could demonstrate the utility of that approach and the data that's out there, and and the tools we thought focusing on shellfish would be a really good place to start for 2 reasons. One, it's a fishery that will be impacted by offshore wind development

560
01:33:53.300 --> 01:34:12.209
Josh Kohut: 2. They don't have fins, and so they don't move, and so it's a it's a fishery. When we think about dynamics, we're at least removing one of the motions, or at least part of one of the motions by focusing on that. And there's already been a very active and engaged discussion

561
01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:15.849
Josh Kohut: among the shellfish community on ways to mitigate

562
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:28.700
Josh Kohut: that includes potentially seeding populations in other part of the region that's not targeted for offshore wind development as a way to transition the fishery to a new location. and so

563
01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:46.710
Josh Kohut: that was something that we felt we could demonstrate a success in 2 years, or at least evaluate whether it's successful or not in 2 years. and then the fin fish is taking advantage of all the great work that many on this team have done, and others outside of this team have done, and and

564
01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:55.800
Josh Kohut: looking at a short-lived species. Again, as a demonstration, because we expect them to be more maybe responsive to local and

565
01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:59.070
Josh Kohut: modern ocean conditions,

566
01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:03.950
Josh Kohut: and that may not get to completion. But at least we can start that development process.

567
01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:04.820
And

568
01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:17.899
Josh Kohut: as you mentioned some of these other ideas that could come in, that's something that can can happen in the out years of the project. But we wanted to have those early successes to show that this is something that could could be useful

569
01:35:19.410 --> 01:35:31.200
Daniel Kuchma: mit.

570
01:35:31.210 --> 01:35:44.580
Daniel Kuchma: So there's the Nsf. Funding, and 160 million over 10 years is actually really modest relative to all the change. challenges that face us. And you know right now the money sort of flows through the lead organization, you know, which is tough.

571
01:35:44.610 --> 01:35:52.480
Daniel Kuchma: and we actually want to, and what we are going to do on day. One is we spin up a parallel organization which is regional.

572
01:35:52.560 --> 01:36:00.550
Daniel Kuchma: for where the wind energy is going to be developed most especially over the next 10 years or so, and we'd really like that to have no address

573
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:03.919
Daniel Kuchma: other than being in the region where it is occurring.

574
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:14.089
Daniel Kuchma: because the individual states and industry. I think there is significant interest in actually investing in things like joint industry projects, etc.

575
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:20.030
Daniel Kuchma: So the Nsf. Money is sort of one pot, and it's going to do a certain number of things.

576
01:36:20.170 --> 01:36:23.380
Daniel Kuchma: But then we're going to have this other spin up entity motion

577
01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:41.999
Daniel Kuchma: right? So that's going to be the name of this nonprofit. but it will do. Is it will leverage and provide a lot of that other type of flexibility that ultimately Nsf. May not be able to actually create because of requirements on top of them in terms of compliance, etc.

578
01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:57.680
Daniel Kuchma: So that is our way that we, you know, stay true to Nsf. We allow the experts to sort of lead initially how this thing gets all kicked off, but at the same time we're able to grow it. So we have these other mechanisms for regional engagement on this.

579
01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:00.609
Daniel Kuchma: So great question, Dan.

580
01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:03.110
Dan O'Connell: thanks. Jen.

581
01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:07.620
Dan O'Connell: yeah, this is Daniel Connell. I'm a ge technical engineer with Baum.

582
01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:14.570
Dan O'Connell: I know quite a few of you, and work with a lot of you already.

583
01:37:14.650 --> 01:37:22.240
Dan O'Connell: I've been with bomb 10 years now, and I've seen, you know, going back way back to the Cape Wendy. So

584
01:37:22.290 --> 01:37:26.270
Dan O'Connell: I've seen how things have really changed. and

585
01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:33.430
Dan O'Connell: you know this level of interest was not did not exist 10 years ago, you know, and it's so much more

586
01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:38.090
Dan O'Connell: interest in people getting it more involved. I think it's great.

587
01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:46.519
Dan O'Connell: Yeah. And everything we talked about today, you know, is affects boom in one way or another. You know, from the environmental group. The policy group

588
01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.080
Dan O'Connell: the one thing I I could see, though, is that

589
01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:53.449
Dan O'Connell: you know the way things stand right now.

590
01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:54.609
Dan O'Connell: You know

591
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:58.779
Dan O'Connell: we we have to follow the regulations as written.

592
01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:01.839
Dan O'Connell: And it's basically

593
01:38:02.010 --> 01:38:04.269
Dan O'Connell: we have to protect the environment.

594
01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:05.580
Dan O'Connell: You know we're not.

595
01:38:06.230 --> 01:38:10.990
Dan O'Connell: Our mission is not to improve the environment. Of course, you know you can interpret it.

596
01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:13.309
Dan O'Connell: Protecting.

597
01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:16.269
Dan O'Connell: you know, kind of a subjective term, but

598
01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:20.319
Dan O'Connell: and and developers are focused on

599
01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.260
Dan O'Connell: the profitability.

600
01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:30.230
Dan O'Connell: These are commercial projects. They're bidding, you know. That's why Lcoe is so critical, because that's what they're bidding.

601
01:38:30.370 --> 01:38:36.450
Dan O'Connell: and they can't their own project. You know they can get all the permits they want. But if they don't have a contract

602
01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:40.710
Dan O'Connell: to sell the electricity, they're not. They can't build a project.

603
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:41.960
Dan O'Connell: And so.

604
01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:47.700
Dan O'Connell: you know, if if we're going to look at social goals and other issues, I think eventually

605
01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:51.119
Dan O'Connell: it's going to require some change in legislation

606
01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:55.270
Dan O'Connell: either With us, with this, with the the States

607
01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.309
Dan O'Connell: the way utilities organizations operate.

608
01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:02.289
Dan O'Connell: because you know, right now there's no

609
01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:05.009
Dan O'Connell: there's no incentive to. Do.

610
01:39:05.490 --> 01:39:08.000
Dan O'Connell: you know, to do some of these ideas.

611
01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:14.930
Dan O'Connell: You know we see it all the time that you know all these options for gravity based, and and other

612
01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.929
Dan O'Connell: up here is to improve. But

613
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:25.950
Dan O'Connell: unless there's a requirement, or or a financial incentive to do that, you know, developers are not going to do that.

614
01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.690
Dan O'Connell: And so I think that's that's the challenge. I mean we

615
01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:33.640
Dan O'Connell: we had bone. There was a lot of frustration having to

616
01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:36.690
Dan O'Connell: follow the regulations as written.

617
01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:38.320
Dan O'Connell: You know we we've been worked.

618
01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:44.789
Dan O'Connell: We're going to come out with some rule changes next year. It's been taking 10 years to do them so

619
01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:48.469
Dan O'Connell: but you know, I I think it's great to

620
01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:55.159
Dan O'Connell: start thinking about the future because things are are really changing right now. We're kind of right at the beginning

621
01:39:55.420 --> 01:40:01.029
Dan O'Connell: of of the whole. You know the 5 years from now, you know it's going to be a lot different. So

622
01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:04.030
Dan O'Connell: now it's the time to start looking for the future. So

623
01:40:04.190 --> 01:40:14.320
Dan O'Connell: you know. I think it's great effort, and I hope to that boom can play a role, and and be involved because I again, it affects all of us at bone.

624
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:22.659
Fara Courtney: Yeah, Dan: thanks so much for those comments. and it's really great to have you here.

625
01:40:22.710 --> 01:40:31.830
Fara Courtney: and you know you just answered any a question. You sort of raised a question, but then answered it in your last comment: If we're going to look to the future

626
01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:39.030
Fara Courtney: and the change that we want to see happen in the future and what is going to happen? We need to start now.

627
01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:57.270
Fara Courtney: and with the understanding that the road to getting there is gonna involve a lot of policy discussion. But right now we're in a such a dynamic period of time where we're transitioning a lot of things on a huge scale

628
01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:07.319
Fara Courtney: with a lot of disruption. So we want to harness that this disruptive time to start embedding some of these new ideas in the thinking, getting the research done

629
01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:12.980
Fara Courtney: when, while we can, to start shifting those directions, and I think

630
01:41:13.050 --> 01:41:15.019
Fara Courtney: from the conversations we've had.

631
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:23.689
Fara Courtney: the companies of which the developers are part of globally are moving in these directions.

632
01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:24.700
Fara Courtney: So

633
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:39.289
Fara Courtney: our ability to respond to that global movement here in the Us is actually going to be a benefit to the industry and help give us the opportunity in this country to can be contributing to that level of innovation 250.

634
01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:40.650
Fara Courtney: So

635
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:45.899
Fara Courtney: we hear you. We're glad you're here, and we really look forward to working with bone to

636
01:41:46.770 --> 01:41:49.159
Fara Courtney: channel the disruption in the right direction.

637
01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:53.100
Okay.

638
01:41:53.660 --> 01:42:00.670
Daniel Kuchma: thank you, Farrah, To have a little bit of I don't see any other hands. David Michelle, are you

639
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:08.160
Daniel Kuchma: on? Because if you are, I think it would be fantastic to have sort of a State perspective comment.

640
01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:12.040
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: Thank you, Dan. I am on in.

641
01:42:12.150 --> 01:42:29.680
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: I've been multitasking during the meeting, but trying to pay most attention to the meeting. As you know, in Connecticut, we're morning the lost the loss of one of our colleagues who passed away right after integration day in the car crash. So it's been a little tough here in Connecticut when we shut down everything legislative until Monday.

642
01:42:29.690 --> 01:42:39.190
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: but the perspective, and i'm sure when for the State of Connecticut you could see it's right in my background. It's an actual nature inclusive

643
01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:52.919
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: approach an approach that not only will protect the marine environment, and I keep repeating this in Connecticut the ocean is the fourth line of defense against climate change. You can't pretend to fight against climate change

644
01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:58.239
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: while threatening the marine environment. That is the very mechanism that is protecting us.

645
01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:09.120
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: And that is why after years of seeing presentation with monopoly and jacket piles, and no graphics of any concrete gravity base

646
01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:25.940
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: for 4 years and presentations. that is why some of us in the State of Connecticut have taken on and asked Tests University to give us a comparative study of the techniques on the footing of the of shore wind turbines. Again, we've not really

647
01:43:26.410 --> 01:43:33.820
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: focused on whatever is above work focusing on what's under order, which is where everything changes.

648
01:43:34.110 --> 01:43:35.650
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: the

649
01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:47.120
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: The approach from the developers from 2,017 all the way to now has been very pushy towards Mobile. I think everybody knows this in the call the

650
01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:56.119
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: There, there's several tiers that we should all be looking at in terms of potential danger with that kind of technique

651
01:43:56.150 --> 01:44:07.770
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: one there is talk. There talks about the scout protections, and they've always said to us in Connecticut in 2,019. First, that concrete gravity base was not a use technique when it's 10% of the offshore will

652
01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:20.749
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: farmers in the world and when it's also most facilities in the water by standing in concrete. So it's sorry to say that concrete is not really used in this kind of construction. then we have

653
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:29.699
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: the idea that so that's the noise part. But then there's everything else that is also worrying. I I will say that

654
01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:39.790
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: right now I hear a lot about floating, but floating in my view, might not be entirely liable. I mean, we have issues for the North Atlantic right wells, and

655
01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:41.410
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: i'm saying.

656
01:44:41.850 --> 01:44:47.839
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: spreading out all over the place. But it's first saying, Why, North, if any right whales are extremely important.

657
01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:50.169
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: because not at all right. Well

658
01:44:50.210 --> 01:44:53.620
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: maintains it's like a garden. They maintain the phytoplankton.

659
01:44:54.100 --> 01:45:06.310
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: The phytoplankton is the source of 3 major things. One is carbon absorption. 2 is the oxygen production, 50 to 80% of oxygen production depending on where and when

660
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:07.450
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: that's

661
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:12.059
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: humongous, and then the phytoplankton is the food for the Zoo plankton.

662
01:45:12.130 --> 01:45:15.820
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: So you lose phytoplankton. You lose your fishing reputations.

663
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:16.920
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: So

664
01:45:17.150 --> 01:45:23.920
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: keystone species are key in this case, and if they are set more sensitive wildlife in the same waters.

665
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:31.080
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: A. And I will go and look for that noise threshold, and I want to put it in the environmental standards in our state.

666
01:45:31.570 --> 01:45:47.060
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: We don't go ahead and do you finish up? Sorry. I thought that was a finishing comment. No, please do. Please continue sorry for the interruption. So you got to stop me, though, you know, because i'll talk for hours, not in fetch and

667
01:45:47.240 --> 01:46:00.409
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: so we're looking at other things right. The bentos, the watercol. All these things are very important. So when i'm hearing like that, was it a presentation from a Was it equin, or or that? Not a thing it was.

668
01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:05.429
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: or instead. But both talk about the floating foundations, and

669
01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:14.579
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: i'm like well when we have a problems with vertical lines and or attending right? Well, so what happens with the north of that right? Well, if, instead of going into a road to and gets entangled.

670
01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:19.129
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: What happens to Northern Denny? Right? Well, that goes into a cable

671
01:46:19.570 --> 01:46:33.889
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: I don't know, and I don't know that anybody knows. So that that is one thing that I I would like people to pay attention to. Again. Keystone species need to be protected. Otherwise, the marine environment, as we know it will change, including

672
01:46:34.110 --> 01:46:48.840
Rep. David Michel, Stamford CT 146th: protection for our lives. I mean, this is part of our life support system. We can't mess with it, and the language coming often from Federal is sometimes scary, because it seems dismissive that we could do it the wrong way.

673
01:46:49.040 --> 01:47:06.599
Daniel Kuchma: Hey, David, i'm gonna say you. You told me to stop you so. the Yes, as you said, there's a lot of issues. There's a lot of complexity. There's a lot of uncertainty. And as one of the things we've been exploring in this project that we are doing for balm and mass, Cec. Is

674
01:47:06.610 --> 01:47:24.539
Daniel Kuchma: even as it pertains to monopiles and other types of structures. you know, Of course, people are working at techniques to try and put them in more quietly. There's decisions we make in terms of perforations on the model piles, the crosion protections, systems, etc., that could also have a very dramatic effect

675
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:31.109
Daniel Kuchma: on the environment. So I think, when we think about ways in which we can make improvements under the water.

676
01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:40.049
Daniel Kuchma: Concrete is one of those ones which is an extremely brings a lot of really nice attributes, and needs a lot more attention than it has received.

677
01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:44.749
Daniel Kuchma: Similarly, we recognize, particularly through augmentation.

678
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:57.300
Daniel Kuchma: because people have been looking. If you have a Jacket. You can start to hang things on it co-located aqua culture, other types of things. So when I look at it and I don't see it necessarily, as you know, steal bad, concrete, good.

679
01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:17.609
Daniel Kuchma: It's like we look at the different options, and there's always going to be compromise, and there's be things we can be doing with existing traditional steel approaches that can still be more nature inclusive. There's a work that I believe, is just about to be published and released to some really effective new pile placement strategies

680
01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:37.290
Daniel Kuchma: that are considerably better than the what people have been exploring today with the pushing and vibration, etc. as opposed to pounding. So, looking forward to learning about that, so innovation across a number of different design solutions will be continuously needed where we are have 10. I'm. So let me let me all. I'm going to jump to something else, because

681
01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:55.580
Daniel Kuchma: David and I and others, we he's he's he's amazing. He's passionate. He's a representative in the Legislature at Connecticut, and he's been really pushing for really doing things in very great responsible ways. So, David, thank you very much for your comments. Jennifer and Gordon, I want to ask you to a question and buying it a preface it

682
01:48:55.730 --> 01:49:03.059
Daniel Kuchma: first. So the way we've been thinking about it in this engine from a standpoint of economic development.

683
01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:06.740
Daniel Kuchma: When we think, for example, on convergent Project Number One.

684
01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:13.710
Daniel Kuchma: where you know, we have who we involved Mbl Florida techs doing some work, and we have some other partners as well

685
01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:31.780
Daniel Kuchma: the way we think about it. You know what we're going to start fabricating, for example, these 3D things that could be scour, protection, or small pieces of steel tubes. And we're going to be coding them. We're going to be adding, You know various types of sensors, so we can put them in the water, and we can learn.

686
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:43.950
Daniel Kuchma: And the way we look at the relationship between, for example, that convergent project and economic development is the research project. goes forward, and it

687
01:49:44.610 --> 01:49:51.200
Daniel Kuchma: does learning. It identifies. Where is the opportunity engages people in a rigorous discussion.

688
01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.620
Daniel Kuchma: and then.

689
01:49:52.840 --> 01:50:05.859
Daniel Kuchma: like the town of New Bedford which you folks represent, and the State can sort of say, hey, is there a real opportunity here, and if there is a really opportunity, what are the investment mechanisms that are needed

690
01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:22.660
Daniel Kuchma: to actually do it of the scale that it actually can provide some significant financial benefit. So when we think of the relationship between these convergent projects being it the one where we're looking at nature inclusive scour protection. Let's say that are learned learning mechanisms for the ocean environment.

691
01:50:22.770 --> 01:50:33.489
Daniel Kuchma: or, in the case of David, just spoke in Connecticut about us, looking at what are the what are the things that we need to do? To sort of look at, counting for some of the advantages of concrete gravity foundations. 150.

692
01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:44.310
Daniel Kuchma: what we see is the convergent project does. Something helps us to learn, brings a community together, communicates with the entities that have some capacity for investment.

693
01:50:44.320 --> 01:51:06.569
Daniel Kuchma: And then collectively, we say, okay, what could we do? Perhaps starting in year? 3 further down the line? Maybe something more of a pilot stage where we have other investment dollars into, in fact, actually to make an advancement which, from nascent monies, would not be sufficient to actually enable it to do it, and wouldn't have the degree of engagement with the community that I think

694
01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:13.130
Daniel Kuchma: we want to achieve, and that nsf really wants to have. So from both of you. It would be fantastic to get your reaction

695
01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:16.029
Daniel Kuchma: to that kind of a strategy of approach.

696
01:51:18.150 --> 01:51:21.129
Gordon Carr, NBPA: Jen's been in her job longer than I have, so she gets to go first.

697
01:51:21.250 --> 01:51:22.690
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: Thanks, Gordon.

698
01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:33.520
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: yeah, you know. I think. as you've outlined the structure for the engine as it stands now, it sounds great, I think. What's missing for Gordon I is.

699
01:51:33.530 --> 01:51:48.459
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: the recognition of existing industry in industry. Right? That you're going to be coming into these communities in New Bedford's case. We have, as you know, a very robust commercial fishing and processing industry. As I was listening to the engine, and how you had lay this out.

700
01:51:48.690 --> 01:51:59.770
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: it becomes more exciting to me when you when you think about the intentional integration of commercial fishing and processing.

701
01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:17.560
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: When we think about societal benefits, and I think what the goal is around this projects. You got to think triple bottom line and existing industries. In any case of New Bedford. You have an industry that counts for 2% of the Massachusetts Gdp: right? 11 over 11 billion dollars

702
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:33.089
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: resulting from our commercial fishing and processing industry. So I think what you're outlining is really in this interesting. I think it has a lot of potential and is very exciting, but I think it becomes much more rich when you are engaging

703
01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:37.740
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: some of the stakeholders, at least in our community that are so very key to the economy.

704
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:44.859
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: and in the fishing, commercial fishing and processing industry there are a lot of opportunities for

705
01:52:44.880 --> 01:53:04.630
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: upgrades innovation that can not only help to sustain that industry, but also can support the environmental concerns that we all have. in the sustainability concerns that we all have, and from our perspective in New Bedford we don't want to see offshore wind and commercial fishing just coexist.

706
01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:19.529
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: We want to see those 2 industries thrive together. because of the one of the things we're looking at at the New Bedford Ocean Cluster is not just the advancement of these individual industries which we very much care about, but we are really interested in how these industries

707
01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:27.390
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: can intersect and enter new markets together and really share the ocean in a way. that

708
01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:43.590
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: is, is not just coexisting. Again, it's it's really forward thinking and thriving, and and we have a lot of forward thinking fishermen in New Bedford that I think if you got them around the table. would be very interested in some of the ideas you're you're talking about. So

709
01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:46.050
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: I don't know Gordon. Do you have anything to add

710
01:53:46.450 --> 01:54:02.000
Gordon Carr, NBPA: just a a couple of things one yes, right. The economic development, which is the the the next to your question, Dan, is an additive business, right? So we're not interested in replacing the industries, and I would, I would also say the other

711
01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:05.810
Gordon Carr, NBPA: benefit, I think of of integrating at least some

712
01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:10.800
Gordon Carr, NBPA: some effects or benefits on the commercial fishing industry is.

713
01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:12.420
Gordon Carr, NBPA: we hear it

714
01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:25.709
Gordon Carr, NBPA: pretty frequently. There's a high degree of hesitancy in that sector for the on coming offshore wind right? There is there has been sort of a latent uncertainty about it, and now it's actually coming, and I think

715
01:54:25.810 --> 01:54:37.120
Gordon Carr, NBPA: we spend a lot of time working with the commercial fishing industry to to prepare them for that. We spent a lot of time with Dan and his colleagues at phone to to to figure out how that how? That's going to work

716
01:54:37.290 --> 01:54:38.989
Gordon Carr, NBPA: and I guess the other

717
01:54:39.150 --> 01:54:48.299
Gordon Carr, NBPA: way. I might try to answer the question that you posed in about once. You have some of these technologies and some of these demonstration applications.

718
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:51.599
Gordon Carr, NBPA: I I sort of go to.

719
01:54:51.730 --> 01:55:04.450
Gordon Carr, NBPA: Who's the customer, right? Who's the end? User the question really that that I think you're asking goes to the actual developers right? And either there are benefits for them to try to test things out or to deploy them.

720
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:25.650
Gordon Carr, NBPA: Or again, Dan and his regulatory folks will require it right. But those are the only 2 ways. The developers, I think, are going to to adopt and integrate some of these things. they're either benefits. There's cost savings or their requirements. I think so. we on the port side, and and the and the city side will be followers. I would say on that

721
01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:33.819
Gordon Carr, NBPA: as far as how to take it from the incredible work that you guys are doing, and the research and and the analysis that you

722
01:55:33.850 --> 01:55:37.189
Gordon Carr, NBPA: towards actual application.

723
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:51.179
Gordon Carr, NBPA: And then the other thing I would say again is, we've said we're in the Mayor's office. and I I I don't see Kevin still on the call. I don't think, but I would urge you to. Oh, no, sorry, Kevin, so it's for you. I was talking not different. Sorry

724
01:55:51.690 --> 01:56:00.309
Gordon Carr, NBPA: to oh, you Are there Great? Excellent. I I I didn't expand my screen. I apologize to you.

725
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:14.630
Gordon Carr, NBPA: is to loop the school marine science and technology into a lot of this on a a on a much more direct basis. Their applied research, and their knowledge of both sides of the of the industry, I think would be hugely valuable. So i'm just going to put in a

726
01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:18.260
Gordon Carr, NBPA: the shameless plug for for Kevin and his colleagues at at SMS

727
01:56:19.650 --> 01:56:20.639
Jennifer Downing (she/her), NBOC: agreed.

728
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:38.989
Gordon Carr, NBPA: I I hope that was somewhat responsive to your question. But no, no, no. I think the perspective that you shared is a critical perspective, and you know, Nsf: the people who are embedded to review this proposal.

729
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:43.650
Daniel Kuchma: Right? They won't have nest. The perspective of the people that are even on this call.

730
01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:53.480
Daniel Kuchma: right. And so in many ways. For this engine to be successful, I should probably in more than many ways. It's really, you know it's your groups who need to ground truth this.

731
01:56:53.620 --> 01:57:11.199
Daniel Kuchma: and as you said, it's about people coming together for discussion. You know one of the reasons showing that big circle of just the complexity of it. And, as you said, you need to work with the folks in a Daniel Connell and a bomb to actually doing this in the environmental group and everything else. So it's. we we we

732
01:57:11.210 --> 01:57:25.860
Daniel Kuchma: we hear you. Not only do we hear you. It's like that's sort of the driving way we need to be thinking about these types of things. And, Kevin, it's great to hear you. Maybe i'll have a ask you for a comment in just a second. But before we do that,

733
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:45.269
Daniel Kuchma: you know, we've tried to learn quite a bit, of course, from what our European colleagues is, and of all the various countries. Everybody always says, Well, the Netherlands actually approach this in the most thoughtful way, because years ago, before getting into offshore wind whatsoever right before they started to do anything of significant scale with. They said, we're going to create

734
01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:59.459
Daniel Kuchma: groups of experts around a lot of individual topics, and then we're going to listen to them, and we're going to do what they in tell us is the best thing to do right. And so I think everybody's applied to the Netherlands efforts, for example.

735
01:57:59.470 --> 01:58:09.289
Daniel Kuchma: to say: You know what, before we go through an auction, these least areas, we're going to go out and do our own geophysical and ge technical investigation, and we're going to make that public.

736
01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:16.669
Daniel Kuchma: This will allow for more competitive bids, and at the same time the most critical aspects. It means the data that's collected

737
01:58:16.770 --> 01:58:27.049
Daniel Kuchma: is a public record. So we are actually learning in the process of doing it right. So that's an example of one amazing idea in this direction.

738
01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:42.330
Daniel Kuchma: and I was looking to see if Luca from Deltares was on. I didn't know she would be she isn't, so i'll speak sort of so for her. But it is really the case that if you actually look at now the bit requirements for developers and all of the tenders and everything in the Netherlands.

739
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:53.030
Daniel Kuchma: It's like, what is the environmental impact? Because I think the question rightly stated right. It's like that. If this is, developers have to do this. Things are very competitive. Who is the market?

740
01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.619
Daniel Kuchma: I think part of that is at least our

741
01:58:56.650 --> 01:58:59.899
Daniel Kuchma: the thinking is, hey, what's in the best drink source of society.

742
01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:05.130
Daniel Kuchma: And if we help the data to be able to actually present what is in the best interests of society.

743
01:59:05.310 --> 01:59:14.369
Daniel Kuchma: then policymakers and right, that can be the the doer, or something like that in Massachusetts, can be looking at a bidding process, and

744
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:25.609
Daniel Kuchma: they list all these metrics of evaluation and developers put forth very often multiple bids, right? So that the State can then select, based on whatever value it attributes to something.

745
01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:45.869
Daniel Kuchma: And if there's data and quantifiable value to doing some of the types of things that we described. I think that is one of the very powerful mechanisms for moving it in directions that we think is, i'm very good. But Kevin, it would be nice to, you know, as someone who works with the developers an incredible amount, and has been thinking about these issues for a lot of years.

746
01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:53.500
Daniel Kuchma: It'd be nice to have your sort of comment, and then I think it's been 2Â h, and then maybe we should probably let people go. But

747
01:59:53.550 --> 02:00:06.899
Daniel Kuchma: we've had half the people stay on till this point, so that's a I think a statement of people sort of interested in this discussion, but it'd be nice to have your comments on what you know the overall objective, and you know how you think we should be looking at these matters?

748
02:00:07.810 --> 02:00:13.469
Kevin Stokesbury: Yeah. Well, thank you. Well, I I You know, of course, in the support of the overall objectiveism.

749
02:00:13.590 --> 02:00:17.819
Kevin Stokesbury: We're part of it. I'm glad, glad to be a part of it. I I do think that the

750
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:25.220
Kevin Stokesbury: the challenges of of of of not detrimentally affecting the the fishing industry

751
02:00:25.370 --> 02:00:28.210
Kevin Stokesbury: are going to be pretty massive.

752
02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.389
Kevin Stokesbury: and I think I I,

753
02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:36.740
Kevin Stokesbury: to be honest, I I think the targets changing as well. I thought, for example, that that

754
02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:42.920
Kevin Stokesbury: all the developers were following the one by one nautical mile grid that the Coast Guard proposed. But I've just

755
02:00:43.090 --> 02:00:47.120
Kevin Stokesbury: heard recently that that might not be the case then in the mid-atlantic, and so

756
02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:49.810
Kevin Stokesbury: you know those kind of shifts, although.

757
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:51.359
Kevin Stokesbury: and perhaps that seems

758
02:00:51.630 --> 02:00:58.300
Kevin Stokesbury: seems trivial. But it it's the difference between a vessel being having access into that area or not. And

759
02:00:58.390 --> 02:01:02.880
Kevin Stokesbury: you know there's there's scientific Ramifications increased uncertainty on

760
02:01:03.070 --> 02:01:06.490
Kevin Stokesbury: on the estimates of fish stocks. There's

761
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:08.660
Kevin Stokesbury: changes in the biology and

762
02:01:09.010 --> 02:01:12.660
Kevin Stokesbury: and some of the presentations showing here. They're starting to get to it.

763
02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:15.330
Kevin Stokesbury: So it's, you know it's a very timely proposal.

764
02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:17.179
Kevin Stokesbury: it is fairly.

765
02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:19.470
Kevin Stokesbury: really massive. And

766
02:01:20.330 --> 02:01:24.059
Kevin Stokesbury: I I also think that

767
02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:31.280
Kevin Stokesbury: getting ahead of this, because the the leases are not starting to be approved on the West Coast as well, and floating turbines.

768
02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:33.869
Kevin Stokesbury: the golf and main that's that's going to be another

769
02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:37.750
Kevin Stokesbury: issue. I know. Some people think maybe they'll work. Maybe they won't. But

770
02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:40.000
Kevin Stokesbury: It seems like things are are going.

771
02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:47.460
Kevin Stokesbury: What i'm struck with with all of it is how all of a sudden it's so full throttle. And really, when you compare the European

772
02:01:47.610 --> 02:01:52.989
Kevin Stokesbury: to the the North American experience here, the Europeans have developed at a growth rate of

773
02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:55.549
Kevin Stokesbury: roughly 20%, whereas we're

774
02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:59.280
Kevin Stokesbury: heading into this at 80, you know. I mean, we're we're

775
02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:02.070
Kevin Stokesbury: going from 0 to 100 and

776
02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:05.320
Kevin Stokesbury: Yeah. So I guess it's gonna be a wild ride.

777
02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:17.080
Gordon Carr, NBPA: I was gonna I was gonna chime in and make a a similar point to Kevin, which is not to be class glass half empty. But time is not our friend with this right? for both

778
02:02:17.290 --> 02:02:21.700
Gordon Carr, NBPA: both the developers and the Regulators right we are. We all have a a

779
02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:27.109
Gordon Carr, NBPA: or are feeling a high degree of urgency for this right, and

780
02:02:27.550 --> 02:02:30.169
Gordon Carr, NBPA: I I will speak only for myself. But

781
02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:45.830
Gordon Carr, NBPA: sometimes my dumbest decision were made in haste. Right. So it's, you know. we got to be very cautious about that, I think, and that's where a lot of the research that you're talking about undertaking is so important, I would say.

782
02:02:47.550 --> 02:02:51.219
Gordon Carr, NBPA: not to end it on and down, because it's been a great conversation. But

783
02:02:51.250 --> 02:03:01.580
Daniel Kuchma: no, I thank you very much for that. Because, yeah, I think everybody recognizes the complexity and the problems that are out there. And if we ignore them, it doesn't mean the problem goes away.

784
02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:07.969
Daniel Kuchma: It does take a very broad community to, in fact, actually do this, which, of course, has been the nature of the approach, the

785
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:18.099
Daniel Kuchma: and it's but this, you know, this is probably a good opportunity. Sorry, and we you know the people who wrote the proposal together right? The 18 organizations, and I actually logged

786
02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:20.690
Daniel Kuchma: over 200 Zoom Meetings.

787
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:33.509
Daniel Kuchma: associated with this, and the number of hours is we don't even want to count the number of hours if you look at everybody collectively. But I think what's happened is with this entity that we now refer to ourselves as motion people we were like.

788
02:03:33.590 --> 02:03:52.160
Daniel Kuchma: Oh, yeah, you know, hopefully Nsf. Will fund this regardless. We need to do this, and we need to find other mechanisms for making progress. even if we can't do it all like a plan for 10 years. Let's we gotta find a mechanism to to start as soon as possible on so many of these elements. We need to keep the community together

789
02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:57.019
Daniel Kuchma: and have the right relationships and everything else. So you know we're we're

790
02:03:57.130 --> 02:04:10.719
Daniel Kuchma: We're we're. I think we all recognize the importance of these types of things. So thank you for your comment on that garden. That could almost be a closing comment. Does anybody else have one final thing they'd like to say. If not, what i'll do is I'll just thank you for your time and

791
02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:14.080
Daniel Kuchma: make brief comment on next step. Does anybody have a closing comment?

792
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:25.450
Josh Kohut: thank you, Dan, for the incredible effort to organize and lead this group, and far as help and the whole team that's leading this. Just thank you for making it easy for us to participate.

793
02:04:25.550 --> 02:04:35.229
Daniel Kuchma: Yeah. Well, it's a topic is the you know. Everybody knows that this is an important thing to work on. So it's been saved self selling. There's been no arm twisting what's wherever you folks have all

794
02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:51.700
Daniel Kuchma: just been absolutely amazing. And throughout all of this and so next steps You'll be everybody who was invited to this. we'll be getting an email. There'll be a link to the recording. the slides I've already distributed in Pdf format.

795
02:04:51.930 --> 02:04:57.040
Daniel Kuchma: and as well, we're going to have a link to the jam board which mentioned is going to be open for a week.

796
02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:11.209
Daniel Kuchma: it will contain links to some office hours next week. As people reflect on things. If they have thoughts and comments. You can put it in jambore. You can send in an email. You can come to one of the you know office hours next week.

Daniel Kuchma: We will also distribute the proposal.

798
02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:17.580
Daniel Kuchma: and the instructions for the proposal are going to say

799
02:05:17.670 --> 02:05:19.479
Daniel Kuchma: we've been doing this iterative.

800
02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:25.119
Daniel Kuchma: We're writing on it, but we still got probably a lot of words smithing to do. Don't try and word Smith anything.

801
02:05:25.230 --> 02:05:31.549
Daniel Kuchma: Look at it. Think about content. What we're trying to achieve. Is it realistic. What are we missing?

802
02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:40.629
Daniel Kuchma: And then just write in comments, and then what we'll do is we'll take those into consideration to the best degree that we can with all of the other constraints.

803
02:05:40.650 --> 02:05:42.800
Daniel Kuchma: we are establishing a website

804
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:55.159
Daniel Kuchma: that in which we have a lot of resources that we're going to put that we're going to be able to reference indirectly in the proposal. So it's going to be a source of growing information, because everybody in this group

805
02:05:55.170 --> 02:06:05.649
Daniel Kuchma: great team together have been saying, oh, this is someone should read this or this is a great informative video that would be wonderful to see. So our entity will create an outreach mechanism in that way.
