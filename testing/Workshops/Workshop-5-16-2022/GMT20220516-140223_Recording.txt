01:10:04	Geoffrey Swain:	Anthony Dvarskas. Is there any evidence that biodiversity is influenced by the choice of structure ie. monopile or jacket.  Thank you
01:16:45	MarcelRoz:	HI Geoffrey, see the DGraer article shared
01:17:56	Fara Courtney:	Drew Carey, on the big issue of connectivity - as the US shifts from looking at individual projects to thinking about OSW as a system of critical energy infrastructure in the ocean - how would you approach modelling this cumulative interaction...is that possible?
01:20:16	Amin Nozari:	Hello everyone, Amin Nozari, Discipline Lead for Integrated Load Analysis at COWI, NY; and former Postdoctoral Scholar at Offshore Wind Energy Engineering program at Tufts University.
01:25:42	David Ciochetto, RI CRMC:	@Jamie - what materials are being used in your 3D printing process?
01:27:26	Jamie Lescinski:	Hi David, we have used different types of mortars and concretes. For the Monaco pilot project, we used a lower carbon concrete which reduced the OPC by utilizing volcanic ash for binding
01:28:43	Frances Bradfield:	Sorry about that everyone.
01:29:06	Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental):	Fara, connectivity has a number of different aspects; broadly these fall into the fixed fauna and the mobile fauna.  Fixed fauna distribution may be affected by the introduction offshore of intertidal habitats and more hard surfaces than currently exist, 'stepping stone' concept demonstrated at BIWF. This can affect both native and non-native species.  Not sure that we have effective models for this process.  Mobile fauna connectivity represents both presence/absence (biodiversity) and energy flow (food webs).  The latter could be modeled particularly as we gather more relevant data.  Hard to apply North Sea data directly to either situation, so the first gen monopile farms like SFW and VW will be very useful to predict cumulative effects.
01:44:29	Anthony Dvarskas:	Hi Geoffrey. On the monopiles versus jackets question, there is the analysis from Belgium (LeFaible) looking at areas around the turbines (not the structures themselves) and indication of larger effect in areas near jackets, but not sure if there are other examples (others on chat may know others). Also can be tough to isolate foundation versus site effects to do cross comparisons.
01:44:54	Fara Courtney:	Andrew Want - how are you incorporating accelerating ocean warming into considerations of biofouling community composition in different regions?
01:47:01	Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental):	Geoffrey there are data from gravity bases vs natural reefs and others mostly cited in the DeGraer et al., 2020 paper.
01:55:47	Andrew Want:	Hi Fara: great question - yes, this is a critical issue. One of my current projects (CHASANS) is looking at connectivity provided by hard substrate infrastructure in the North Sea. We are using our knowledge of currents flows and larval dispersal mechanisms to model connectivity and to compare this with predicted changes expected in the upcoming decades...
01:58:00	anthonysetiadi:	Is there an issue with the bio-fouling or fish species on the cables or attachments internally of the monopile? There have been stories (unverified) of some species eating the cables or rope suspending the anodes internally
02:08:15	David Ciochetto, RI CRMC:	For the flow v. water replenishment holes - can you share any of your results on dominant current v. hole orientation? also are you considering depth dependent currents or more barotropic flow?
02:15:59	bruinsma:	Hi David, we can have a chat about the effect of the hole orientation. What we do is evaluate the waterreplenishment design, where the structure dimension is taken into account as well as the orientation and size of the holes, with the direction and strength of the waves and currents in a certain area. Here we look at the depth integrated profile of both the waves and the current. Happy to talk more about this. Cheers, Niek
02:21:28	Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental):	We know that openings allow mobile organisms to enter the monopile, has anyone studied the interaction of predation on biological growth inside the monopile?
02:25:35	Daniel Kuchma:	https://www.menti.com/gwo1sq5rt5
02:27:57	John Cushing:	With regard to "sealed" vs. "perforated" monopiles, I wasn't clear on what is the current practice with the wind farms in Europe - are they mostly sealed or perforated, or does it just vary from project to project?
02:33:39	Shiladitya Paul:	We did some tests with 90% exposed steel and Al 1050 and found the amount of Al in synthetic seawwater solution after 7 days was 2.45 mg L-1
02:34:09	Birit Buhr:	It is not popular to retrofit holes, but limiting the amount of anode material in different depth is an option. Some guidanace on current density relative to oxygen content can be found in the upcoming ISO 24656.
02:36:08	Brandon Jensen (BOEM):	Thank you everyone. Highly informative.
02:36:10	KRICAR:	Thank you all for your efforts on this topic - some amazing science and progress! Further, thank you for your time today, this was a fantastic presentation. Looking forward to following and keeping tabs on all of the research
