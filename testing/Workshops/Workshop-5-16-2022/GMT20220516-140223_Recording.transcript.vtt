1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.469
Daniel Kuchma: record to the cloud.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:12.660
Daniel Kuchma: So welcome everybody, thank you very much for participating in this event, on behalf of the advisory panel and the rest of the research.

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:26.220
Daniel Kuchma: This is greatly appreciated, my name is Dan Kuchma i'm at tufts university tufts university is located in the Boston area just before we get underway i'll remind people sort of mute please unless you're speaking.

4
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:41.040
Daniel Kuchma: So I think we have our really exceptional group of speakers today and that the workshops workshop should be very informative and inspiring as well, I know I was inspired by looking through people's slides that they're going to present.

5
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.950
Daniel Kuchma: will begin with a little bit of a short introduction to the project what we're trying to achieve in the workshop etc, and then for Part One

6
00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:09.690
Daniel Kuchma: john if you want to tab it's going to be a number of presentations which we could consider to be more motivations and examples of nature, inclusive design, and this is primarily going to be looking at the results of some field studies, plus some great initiatives so part two.

7
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.630
Daniel Kuchma: What we're going to do is discuss for specific topics that are particularly pertinent for pertinent to this particular project for bomb.

8
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.290
Daniel Kuchma: So let me continue sort of with a little bit more of an introduction before we get to Part one so next slide john.

9
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:39.240
Daniel Kuchma: So if you go back 10 years or so it was assumed that the inside of mono piles were airtight watertight and therefore once corrosion started an oxygen was depleted, it would stop.

10
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.410
Daniel Kuchma: Unfortunately, there was leakages and to be completely closed those off was not possible so corrosion continued.

11
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:57.000
Daniel Kuchma: And so bomb has you know, has funded studies to look at this and so the study we're looking at at the moment john if you would bring up the perfect.

12
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:08.670
Daniel Kuchma: Is they've asked for recommendations for what should be used for corrosion protection systems on the inside of mana piles with consideration of air and water chemistry.

13
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:18.510
Daniel Kuchma: Which depending on what you choose can be a little bit problematic, so our research proposal and project has these four elements.

14
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:29.430
Daniel Kuchma: One is to look at the impact of the selected corrosion protection system, and by that we mean coding and pathetic protection in the extent to the extent of coatings etc.

15
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.210
Daniel Kuchma: As well as perforations on what type of chemistries you have internally, as well as what type of questions you have.

16
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:47.040
Daniel Kuchma: As a second element, we are looking at the impact of adding perforations for air and water exchange on structural design and loadings that will be the subject of the next workshop.

17
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.120
Daniel Kuchma: Number three is looking at the impact of the selected crochet and protection systems and perforations on ring gross and habitats.

18
00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:05.070
Daniel Kuchma: This is what this one is about number four is we are developing plans for needed field in laboratory studies for advancing science and practice.

19
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.970
Daniel Kuchma: And this summer we're looking forward and hoping to get underway with a field study so next slide john you are you we're good there.

20
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:27.450
Daniel Kuchma: And thinking about our talk today it's important to be aware, of course, as soon as we start putting hard skates into the environment they these they attract a lot of growth particular different types of brain growth depending on.

21
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.370
Daniel Kuchma: area dependent on aerials.

22
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.750
Daniel Kuchma: And this is something that we don't understand in the science as much as we really need to.

23
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:46.260
Daniel Kuchma: And one of the functions of the discussions today is to sort of advanced everybody's understanding and also identify where we need to understand things a little bit better.

24
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:56.580
Daniel Kuchma: And in thinking about this at least the research team sort of have two thoughts one thought is if we do good things to the marine habitats, with the structures we design.

25
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:05.340
Daniel Kuchma: Then perhaps we can develop hundreds of gigabytes of offshore wind, but if we do things that are not are harmful to the environment and people's livelihoods.

26
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.480
Daniel Kuchma: We probably won't get the opportunity to fight climate change to the offshore wind, to the degree that we really wish that we want to.

27
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:27.210
Daniel Kuchma: And I guess the second thought is based on the examinations It really seems that we can do this, but there is some advancement in science and there's going to be some field trials, etc, in order to do it in the most responsible and reliable way so next slide.

28
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:45.720
Daniel Kuchma: The research team, the contracted research team just swain and cackler from Florida Institute of Technology colleen hansel and Lena from woods hole oceanographic institution and then myself and john and who done from toughs next we have a fantastic advisory panel.

29
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.200
Sid Falk(BOEM): Who.

30
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.180
Daniel Kuchma: come from across the world and bring incredible experience in design.

31
00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:03.690
Daniel Kuchma: And they represent a lot of different stakeholder communities and we're very appreciate further efforts, as well as a number of other folks who you're going to hear from today in the presentations and in the moderated discussions next.

32
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:15.300
Daniel Kuchma: So we've had eight workshops six on the previous project we did for bomb on corrosion and fatigue and then this is our second workshop on this project.

33
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:27.510
Daniel Kuchma: A workshop can sort of have a range of different characters one end on the extreme left it can be informative presentations and that's what the workshop today is principally about.

34
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.410
Daniel Kuchma: Some of the other workshops that we've had is been more of a technical committee meeting where people are sharing the expertise.

35
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.130
Daniel Kuchma: and debating.

36
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:49.020
Daniel Kuchma: identifying where there's consensus where there's differences of opinion and what degrees of uncertainty are okay next john so meeting logistics logistics, please stay muted, unless you are speaking meetings being recorded.

37
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.760
Daniel Kuchma: Next.

38
00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:02.370
Daniel Kuchma: Okay, so we'd like to make really extensive use of chat today, so please use chat to introduce yourself to the degree that you wish feel free to include.

39
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:16.440
Daniel Kuchma: links and then, if as we're going through the presentations and discussion you're thinking of projects people things in the literature that you think would be helpful to be shared, this would be a great benefit.

40
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.260
Daniel Kuchma: Similarly, would be your suggestions for future research that is needed.

41
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:31.740
Daniel Kuchma: If you have questions for speakers and moderators there anybody else put forth those questions as well, even if there isn't time for us to answer.

42
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:41.250
Daniel Kuchma: them and discuss them at this workshop what we're going to do is we're going to have minutes from this workshop and we're going to take those questions and try and answer.

43
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:53.880
Daniel Kuchma: them as best as possible and is any good PhD student knows when they first start communicating with their advisors it's like the most important thing, are the questions that you try and answer so.

44
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.440
Daniel Kuchma: we're greatly appreciative of your contributions to things in this way.

45
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:08.820
Daniel Kuchma: We are not got when we put forth the Minutes and list the questions and other comments and suggestions, other than, of course, your self introduction, we are not going to be.

46
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:19.260
Daniel Kuchma: Recording your names in the chat so feel free to suggest what you make initially seem like you're crazy idea, and when we get into discussions will use the raise hand.

47
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:27.600
Daniel Kuchma: approach, some people like to turn on their video as a way of flagging us if they have a question, so we don't miss you and so john next slide.

48
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:39.720
Daniel Kuchma: So we're going to get right on to part one, and so we have four great talks lined up and so we'll get ready underway, I believe Rebecca with yours.

49
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.820
Rebecca Green: Fantastic Thank you Dan and good morning everyone or Good afternoon, depending on what part of the world you're in.

50
00:07:51.660 --> 00:08:02.400
Rebecca Green: it's a pleasure to be joining you my name is Rebecca green am a senior scientist with the national renewable energy laboratory here in the US or nrl.

51
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:15.990
Rebecca Green: My PhD is in biological oceanography i've been in general now for about three and a half years and I work on a variety of offshore wind activity, including in the environmental space.

52
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:27.150
Rebecca Green: Fishing access multi use of the ocean and citing as well as feasible, a feasibility studies around offshore wind development.

53
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:42.060
Rebecca Green: So it's my pleasure today to be here with my kochi I marks every from the Pacific Northwest national laboratory and i'll give him a chance to introduce themselves in just a minute we're here representing our.

54
00:08:42.990 --> 00:09:01.920
Rebecca Green: Do you funded sear project or which stands for the US offshore wind synthesis of environmental effects research project and it's our pleasure to provide an overview for you today of the goals of this project, where we're at and where we're going in the future.

55
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.990
Sid Falk(BOEM): So meeting is being recorded.

56
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.650
Rebecca Green: With that mark would you like to introduce yourself as well, please.

57
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:13.800
Mark Severy: Sure thanks Rebecca everyone i'm mark I work at Pacific Northwest national laboratory.

58
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:21.420
Mark Severy: And it's been great to collaborate with Rebecca and her team on this project, I am a mechanical engineer by training.

59
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:34.200
Mark Severy: But my work is broadly in the offshore wind space and primarily focused now on offshore wind and in wildlife effects, so I work on this project, and then I broadly work on developing and testing.

60
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:42.690
Mark Severy: wildlife monitoring technologies for a show locations, so I would pass back to Rebecca who's going to start us with with overview.

61
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:53.730
Rebecca Green: Excellent thanks, and I think mark, we decided to get the award for being the earliest participant on the call so thanks for joining on the Monday morning next slide please.

62
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:06.270
Rebecca Green: Great so First, we have a brief introduction to our theater project we're a little over two and a half years into the project now.

63
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:20.070
Rebecca Green: This work is being performed at the direction of the US Department of energy's office of energy efficiency and renewable energy, when energy technologies office, otherwise known as do ITTO.

64
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:39.990
Rebecca Green: between our two national laboratories piano now and and realm or jointly performing this work, which is a multi year collaborative effort to facilitate knowledge transfer from around the world, related to the environmental effects of offshore wind energy development.

65
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:51.990
Rebecca Green: In terms of project objectives, these are multi fold, we have been working over the last couple of yours to summarize the international understanding.

66
00:10:52.650 --> 00:11:02.070
Rebecca Green: of environmental effects monitoring tools and mitigation strategies for offshore wind development again from around the world, so globally.

67
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:21.690
Rebecca Green: And how it applies to both the US Atlantic and Pacific coast and potential offshore wind energy development in those areas we are specifically examining which of the state of the art methods and technologies that are currently being used are relevant to environmental issues.

68
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.210
Rebecca Green: With application to us offshore wind development.

69
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.360
Rebecca Green: We are identifying.

70
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:39.720
Rebecca Green: The knowledge and research gaps, based on the diversity of species habitat users and stressors that we see here in the US.

71
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:52.650
Rebecca Green: with consideration for US Environmental legal and regulatory structure, as well as technological innovations down the road, both in terms of the types of fixed bottom and floating platforms.

72
00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:01.680
Rebecca Green: That could be deployed looking ahead, as well as the types of monitoring and minute minimization technologies that can be used.

73
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:22.770
Rebecca Green: And perhaps most importantly we're working collaboratively to develop outcomes with existing science entities and regional organizations who have are also working hard to minimize the environmental effects of officer and when development alright next slide please.

74
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:31.620
Rebecca Green: So there are three main products from our see your activity and there's a qr code here.

75
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:42.120
Rebecca Green: as well if you'd like to go to the link otherwise, if we haven't already will put the link to the fear project in the chat our first.

76
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:52.830
Rebecca Green: deliverable or activity what's about to develop a series of educational research briefs there's seven of these briefs which will overview in just a minute.

77
00:12:53.190 --> 00:13:00.420
Rebecca Green: They review the state of the knowledge on stressor and receptor interactions monitoring methods and technologies.

78
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:23.910
Rebecca Green: mitigation measures and cumulative impacts related to seven topics, whether it's underwater noise, the effects potential effects of EMF on considerations for birds and BATs and, like our second deliverable our product was a series of webinars over viewing each brief.

79
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:37.080
Rebecca Green: With an expert panel folks from both the US and Europe we're very thankful to the experts who reviewed these educational research briefs and also served on these panels.

80
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:47.730
Rebecca Green: These webinars were run from last november's through this this February, disseminating the findings from the research briefs.

81
00:13:48.390 --> 00:14:02.460
Rebecca Green: To the offshore wind industry and others who are interested and we're extremely well attended so certainly a lot of interest in these topics in the Community and finally we're.

82
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.140
Rebecca Green: Working on a set of research recommendations for both the US Atlantic.

83
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:22.950
Rebecca Green: And Pacific coast to summarize information gaps and barriers current challenge or challenges around us officer when development to to inform and guide future efforts next slide please.

84
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:31.980
Rebecca Green: So these are the the seven topics that we addressed in a series of educational research briefs.

85
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:43.890
Rebecca Green: A year on stakeholder engagement identify these topics, these are topics where stakeholders felt that there was enough information to put together and it.

86
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:54.150
Rebecca Green: A research bry that could be short and succinct as a science summary on what we currently know and some of the research questions moving forward.

87
00:14:54.540 --> 00:15:09.150
Rebecca Green: So these seven topics, most of these have been published our last two will be coming out soon we analyze underwater noise effects on marine life or synthesize existing information on underwater noise effects and marine life.

88
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:20.370
Rebecca Green: BAT and bird interactions with offshore wind industry and the next topic here relates to entanglements so the risks to marine life from marine debris.

89
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:28.290
Rebecca Green: And floating cable systems, whether through primary or secondary entanglement or even possibly tertiary entanglement.

90
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:37.170
Rebecca Green: One of the briefs will be talking about in detail today is the one on benthic disturbance from foundations anchors and cable.

91
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:54.600
Rebecca Green: will also be talking about the direction of new structures or artificial reef effects on fish ecology, we also had a brief on vessel collisions and one on electromagnetic field effects from offshore wind next slide please.

92
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.650
Daniel Kuchma: And Rebecca just if you can to master so so I know.

93
00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.990
Daniel Kuchma: A brief time goes by, very quickly.

94
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:10.440
Rebecca Green: Yes, well, I will turn this over then to mark and just a second so in terms of the introduction of new offshore wind farm structures on fish ecology.

95
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:21.000
Rebecca Green: These are some main takeaways that we provide within that brief around the placement of new structures and potential artificial reef of facts.

96
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:31.080
Rebecca Green: Of what's been documented at European wind farms, for example in terms of the attraction of fish and in first wind farms in US waters.

97
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:40.380
Rebecca Green: What we think what we know for both fixed bottom and potentially for floating wind farms, a variety of monitoring.

98
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:59.760
Rebecca Green: tools exist and methods and types of data collection and then we also synthesize best management practices such as reciting and choice of structures in this brief and I will turn it over to mark next to talk about thunderbird.

99
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:09.180
Mark Severy: And you can go to the next slide as well um this brief talks about the big disturbances from offshore wind structure is actually no one back it's okay.

100
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:17.430
Mark Severy: For you know the benthic disturbances from foundations anchors cables associated with offshore wind farms and their effect on the.

101
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:25.680
Mark Severy: Environment this primarily occurs during after construction and also a little bit in the decommissioning effect of spending how the bed thing environment kind of.

102
00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:35.010
Mark Severy: moves into that area, so the primary is so three things i'll just say briefly check out the brief and maybe many of you know this.

103
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:44.460
Mark Severy: The primary effects on the bed think habitat are generally localized the area closest to laughter when the infrastructures, this is generally read around the the turbines themselves.

104
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:52.260
Mark Severy: The primary effects can occur lots of can include lots of habitat from the new subsea equipment that's installed.

105
00:17:53.100 --> 00:18:03.180
Mark Severy: Conversion of that habitat through the introduction of new hard struggle substrate and then lastly seabed disturbance and recovery after the construction titties.

106
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:13.650
Mark Severy: So let's move on to the next slide and i'll just talk about our upcoming and ongoing efforts and really our ongoing efforts are focused around.

107
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.510
Mark Severy: developing research recommendations, both on the Atlantic coast and on the.

108
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:36.000
Mark Severy: On the Pacific coast and then maintaining a list of those research recommendations on these we published on teeth us they're kind of ongoing mouse or hosting workshops that are been generate that the those research recommendations and then we hope to keep them updated.

109
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:54.150
Mark Severy: You know, ongoing manner through the through our website so with that Thank you all for your attendance, you can go to the next slide which has our contact information, if you would like to follow up feel free to send an email to either me or Rebecca and thanks Dan.

110
00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:05.550
Daniel Kuchma: Thank you Rebecca Thank you mark and as if you think of questions for Rebecca and mark, please do include them in the chat so drew I see your online so it's over to you.

111
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:15.840
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): Alright, thanks i'm going to move very fast the slides are here for your reference you're going to see the same pictures over and over again and.

112
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:25.890
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): i'm stunned at how many slides we have this is a synthesis of work done in the US, as well as referencing work in.

113
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:32.880
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): Europe so i'm going to move pretty quickly here just acknowledging the other folks if you can go on to the next slide.

114
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:39.630
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): So the, this is just a summary of work that has been done at the block island wind farm.

115
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:48.270
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): Including rodeo and that'll be on the next slide so it's really important to understand there were only five turbines these are lattice jacket.

116
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:59.370
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): So they do not relate to the dominant topic of this workshop, which is large circumference mono piles and what may or may not go on inside them.

117
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:11.820
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): So keep that in mind, so lots of different work I posted some links to these publications and i'll put my email up for some reason they don't work next slide please.

118
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:25.380
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): So this is an overview from rodeo That was a bone funded project which actually looked specifically at growth on the structure and the changes to the bentos.

119
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:36.480
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): We did work more on fish ecology of surrounding these turbines and that report is available and linked down below their next.

120
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:54.330
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): So a quick spin through this, this has been said many times in many different places, but essentially the Marine growth and I just want to make the point we're going to be talking about marine growth bio fouling a lot of different terms from an ecological perspective.

121
00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:05.880
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): i'm not a fan of any negative values associated with growth from an engineering perspective that's a different point so we're going to focus on growth here.

122
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:15.120
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): structure goes in the water, it goes from the intertidal all the way down to the sea floor, regardless of whether it's floating or not there is some connection.

123
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:26.910
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): So what happens is we do change the bottom there's a lot of energy flow, as a result of the introduction of this our focus is largely on the flow of energy.

124
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:44.400
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): And through enrichment through the growth on the structure and so the structure itself has this growth, but the sea floor around it also becomes modified and all this becomes a shift in the food web in the location next.

125
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:52.920
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): And we really focus on how this biomass may be exported to the larger ecosystem, because unless we understand this.

126
00:21:53.190 --> 00:22:08.670
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): We really don't understand the function of all that biodiversity on the structure so it's really important to follow energy in a food web or in an ecosystem, and this is where the nature design comes in that I think some folks are going to talk about next slide.

127
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:30.120
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): Another important thing is this concept of connectivity we don't really have core doors in the marine environment, we have larval distribution and movement, and so this can affect both desirable species focal species, but also potentially non native species next slide.

128
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:40.980
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): So the food web is is the focus here how does, how does, how does this change the habitat and that's what we're beginning to look into next slide.

129
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:49.710
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): So we are going to do a project at the Virginia there's only two turbines there.

130
00:22:50.130 --> 00:23:10.290
Drew Carey (INSPIRE Environmental): We have an opportunity to look at how some aspects of nature, enhance design may or may not affect this broader range so there's two turbines will enhance one, not the other and use a lot of the techniques that you're going to hear about from other speakers so Dan I can stop right there.

131
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:20.040
Daniel Kuchma: drew if you don't mind i'm going to thank you for the expediency of a presentation, but.

132
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:29.970
Daniel Kuchma: You caught, a lot of very important key points and the slides were very, very illustrative and so, since I know time is going to be an issue today.

133
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:40.800
Daniel Kuchma: What i'm going to recommend if people have present questions for drew about password future work, please do send him a please add something to chat.

134
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:58.680
Daniel Kuchma: And then we'll make sure that we get responses to those questions or share those thoughts as part of the Minutes, and so, with that then we'll move on to the next presentation and so Anthony is going to be Anthony followed by marcel's so they have a joint presentation.

135
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:14.010
Anthony Dvarskas: Thanks thanks Dan hi everyone Anthony diverse guess here i'm the centrist myself on the biodiversity lead from North America, offshore first dead on, and I wanted to start off here just.

136
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:30.210
Anthony Dvarskas: If people have not heard about it just let everyone know about the biodiversity ambition that we have or said, which is that by 2030 there will be net positive biodiversity product and all renewable energy projects that are commissioned.

137
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:36.180
Anthony Dvarskas: And, as a result of that we're very interested in exploring.

138
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:42.990
Anthony Dvarskas: You know, we don't know what the best way is to get those biodiversity uplifts and so we're very interested in exploring the different kinds of.

139
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:59.190
Anthony Dvarskas: strategies that we may use either at the offshore wind facilities themselves or within proximity to those facilities, and so I just wanted to go through a couple of examples of some things we've started to do to look at that biodiversity uplift question so next slide please.

140
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:09.420
Anthony Dvarskas: And the most recent thing that I that I hope and think, maybe you all have seen in the in the news is the recoil project, which is a.

141
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:17.640
Anthony Dvarskas: what's best phrased as a core restoration experiment at this point and it's off the coast, the west coast of Taiwan.

142
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:27.300
Anthony Dvarskas: south of where the Chang well one into a offshore wind farms are located, and what this project is doing is taking surplus.

143
00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:39.450
Anthony Dvarskas: Indigenous coral spawn that are collected off of the islands that are also west of the Taiwan mainland those sponsor that incubated back in a laboratory into the coral larval stage.

144
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:44.610
Anthony Dvarskas: And then those larvae are transferred and there's a lot more details in terms of that transfer that.

145
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:56.730
Anthony Dvarskas: That we don't have time to get into today, but basically they're they're brought the idea is that they'll be brought out to those turbine foundations and transfer there and settlement will be facilitated and then ideally.

146
00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:11.070
Anthony Dvarskas: They will start to grow on those foundations and person is looking at this as a proof of concept kind of trial again as an experiment and, hopefully, if this approach works in terms of a strategy for.

147
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:18.630
Anthony Dvarskas: Growing these coral there's the possibility of scaling this up to two other locations, as appropriate.

148
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:27.000
Anthony Dvarskas: And there's a lot more information about this available online and on our website and some videos that you could check out the next slide please.

149
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:39.600
Anthony Dvarskas: um one of the other efforts that we've made is around the area of artificial reef creation and i'm just going to see a lot of this is not in North America, but is over in Europe.

150
00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.280
Anthony Dvarskas: and

151
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.930
Anthony Dvarskas: At one project site, there were some boulders that needed to be.

152
00:26:47.160 --> 00:27:04.920
Anthony Dvarskas: moved as a result of the project activities and the idea was that, instead of moving those boulders you know and removing them to onshore locations that perhaps they could be rearranged and into a configuration that would facilitate.

153
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:21.330
Anthony Dvarskas: You know, some kind of use by by organisms, so there were 5000 words that will be located near the end hold offshore wind farm in Denmark in 2012 and there were 23 artificial reefs that were able to be created by those.

154
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:28.830
Anthony Dvarskas: By rearrangement of those boulders, so this is one example, the ways we're trying to look throughout the project lifecycle to think, where we might be able to.

155
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:35.130
Anthony Dvarskas: incorporate these kind of benefits to biodiversity next slide please.

156
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:46.650
Anthony Dvarskas: Also, more recently, than that in 2021 we have these bio huts that you can see a picture of that were created in work that we're doing with w wf.

157
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:52.440
Anthony Dvarskas: To and there are 10 of these they're installing grinnell harbor in the streets.

158
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:57.540
Anthony Dvarskas: Danish kind of guts on the idea here is that this will provide a shelter for.

159
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:06.360
Anthony Dvarskas: The juvenile fish and ideally restore cod populations and also in doing that help help to restore the ecosystem balance and you can see these.

160
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:15.390
Anthony Dvarskas: These cages have have some oyster Shell within them and they're lowered into the water, and then they will be monitored over time to see to see what what actually happens as a result of their.

161
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:28.440
Anthony Dvarskas: placement in the environment and next slide please, and lastly here and then i'll pass it off to Marcel we have the cart cod pipe reefs at the marcella wind farm in the Netherlands.

162
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:35.520
Anthony Dvarskas: Island waters and again this is our artificial reef creation project and.

163
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:45.420
Anthony Dvarskas: There are four of these cod pipe cod purpose built complexes that referred to there that are bad 10 meters diameter and have variable heights.

164
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:52.860
Anthony Dvarskas: And again, the focus here is on providing habitat for Atlantic cod since there's an interest in Atlanta cod within the region.

165
00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:08.520
Anthony Dvarskas: And there is ongoing monitoring that is occurring of the cotton lobster behavior and i'm going to pass it on to Marcel now, in the interest of time to give you some more details on the work that is going on specific to that thanks very much.

166
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:25.770
MarcelRoz: Thanks Anthony for your nice introduction doing a lot of work, indeed, I would like to go into more detail on the Court work and lots of work we're doing, and this is a collaboration between us first that.

167
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:39.300
MarcelRoz: Taking wind on see which is a finance finance financing program and the rich north see who had a grant from the possible ultra next slide please.

168
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:49.260
MarcelRoz: yeah what we're performing this experiment in Barcelona, to which is one of the offshore wind farms, of course, that.

169
00:29:50.460 --> 00:30:01.110
MarcelRoz: As you see, it's about it's in the south of hormones, on the border with Belgium and L 08 is a multiple where we have.

170
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.060
MarcelRoz: were set has positioned for reefs next slide please.

171
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:14.370
MarcelRoz: So here in the middle of the green part you see Ls l.

172
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:23.610
MarcelRoz: Zero and around it for circles, would there be some is there some pointer.

173
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.810
MarcelRoz: And now well if you go.

174
00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:42.510
MarcelRoz: yeah that's one of you go to the right that three two and then, if you go down the southern recently for and the beef three and reform, and they have.

175
00:30:43.140 --> 00:31:01.110
MarcelRoz: arch slightly differently arched That means that they have anti scour and the reefs in the north, they don't have any scour around those reefs the red circles, we have placed 16 frames with on tennis and next slide please.

176
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:19.380
MarcelRoz: And we have tagged about next slide please we have talked about last year 45 courts around all these reefs divided more or less equally in time or in space.

177
00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:30.000
MarcelRoz: And we would like to know what is the distribution of the court in time and space, for instance, are they homebound do they stick to the REACH.

178
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:42.300
MarcelRoz: And are there differences in behavior between the reefs between themselves and also with the Mona bell because, if you remember the setup the entrepreneurs also cover the mono by.

179
00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.850
MarcelRoz: And next slide please.

180
00:31:46.290 --> 00:32:00.600
MarcelRoz: And this is an example of how we have been tagging and Sophie is catching once an animal is court and it's 32 centimeters or bigger we opened the.

181
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.110
MarcelRoz: The belly and in the belly we place attack.

182
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:12.030
MarcelRoz: We saw we saw it back, we saw the belly.

183
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:24.510
MarcelRoz: back with so it's not open again and we place an additional tag in the just near the spine, so we know from the outside the animal has a has a.

184
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:42.570
MarcelRoz: tag inside this acoustic text they sing they send out a thing, and this thing is every minute and it's called by and once it's caught by at least the of the 16 and Dennis you know where it is after recovery they get them all over the place, black.

185
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:53.220
MarcelRoz: And nice for you to know that currently at this very moment people are catching called again and said boss next slide please.

186
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:59.550
MarcelRoz: Lots of tagging and next slide for the love Sir i'm very interested in.

187
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:07.290
MarcelRoz: The i'm very interested in the habitat us in relation to the REACH and also.

188
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:18.180
MarcelRoz: So what is the habitat us is also the serfs subside use, for instance for walking or for for migration or introduce for hunting.

189
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:37.350
MarcelRoz: Is there and what is, for instance, the speed in relation to the type of ships shift threats, what is, what are the rhythms what is the daily reason was what is the seasonal rhythm and also what are the distances covered, because one of the the.

190
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.500
MarcelRoz: Research we're doing is serving to.

191
00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:47.190
MarcelRoz: Lourdes so one of the Lord is to buy diversity, but on the other end we also serve.

192
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:50.400
MarcelRoz: The fisheries and.

193
00:33:52.740 --> 00:34:05.280
MarcelRoz: There is a development going on, that we wouldn't want to have not to use in offshore wind farms and one of the forms of uses uses can be fisheries and then.

194
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:19.590
MarcelRoz: We have the safety factor that all these cages have to be placed at at least two and 50 meters from the mono files and from the infield cables and up to my knowledge.

195
00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:29.670
MarcelRoz: What we've seen so far is that loves us will go to an cage at a maximum of one on the 25 meter, so I would like to know.

196
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:42.780
MarcelRoz: What is the normal behavior of these losses and is there a tense day will be caught by lobsters play by cages placed at more than two and 50 meters distance next slide please.

197
00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:58.620
MarcelRoz: So we had to buy the loves us we had not the means yet to catch lobsters and also the expectation that there would not be a lot of lobster since it the reef is quite new.

198
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:23.700
MarcelRoz: And here, you see a picture of the lobster and the if you see the the black to type of thing that is the attack it's like how the size model as part of a lot of your finger and then we have a tag and number two additional tag.

199
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:43.290
MarcelRoz: The the yellow string which is attacked to the which is yeah also more to the right if you go to mortal right that's attached to the acoustic tech, and then we have also placed one in the back so once the love Sir that's on the left side the previous one, you touch.

200
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:58.440
MarcelRoz: So, once they have shed their skin and their harness then this bactec will will remain and we've bought lots of one and a half kilo or more.

201
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:17.520
MarcelRoz: So the maximum of they shared their their mold every one and a half to two years, so, on average, we expect a half a year of information on each lobster next slide please.

202
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.080
Daniel Kuchma: And two minutes.

203
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:28.110
MarcelRoz: Okay i'll speed up, so this is the typical results that i'm expecting on the left side you see the behavior pattern of a lobster.

204
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:36.780
MarcelRoz: On on in this case in England on soft and hard surface on the right side you see a graph that that.

205
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:52.020
MarcelRoz: On the access as you see an increase in the presented to fart substrate an owner on the ISS you see the speed and you see that on soft subside they walk faster than hearts upset next slide please.

206
00:36:54.180 --> 00:37:00.300
MarcelRoz: Somebody collaborating with us history, I cannot say, and they are really interested in collecting a DNA.

207
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:14.910
MarcelRoz: By and then they eat DNA you ever have water sample which can tell you something on the local by diversity, the the spatial resolution is quite good at the moment you take.

208
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:29.040
MarcelRoz: You take a sample on on when the water doesn't run again i've got the English word, then you will see that that that the DNA environmental DNA is really the presenting the.

209
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:30.960
MarcelRoz: Next slide please.

210
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.050
MarcelRoz: My first results next slide.

211
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:38.130
MarcelRoz: So we've taken out we try to take out.

212
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.960
MarcelRoz: The antennas to get the data 13 were recovered.

213
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:57.960
MarcelRoz: Completely one we recover the data, but we lost it frame and two frames two antennas are still stuck in below in the mud, and then, if you go down to the right side.

214
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:17.520
MarcelRoz: There we see presence data, and so we see the first row, the first 45 rows are the Court and then, if you go down, you see the first presence of the of the law officers, so the.

215
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:31.470
MarcelRoz: The rows in which the a is more to the to the left, those are lots of data, and so a lot of dots loves us have have melted or our last do to.

216
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:47.970
MarcelRoz: Do to do to currents that place is really a current I rich area, so these animals can be washed away and coming one Wednesday i'm going out again and release another batch of lots of.

217
00:38:49.170 --> 00:39:00.510
MarcelRoz: So this was it if you have any questions later on or by the chat i'm available, and this is my email address and telephone number, where you can reach me thank you.

218
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:12.600
Daniel Kuchma: Thank you ever so much a lot of inspiring work and it's just great to see the level of evaluations occurring and, as we know, in the US, this is all critically important to us so Jamie.

219
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:25.890
Jamie Lescinski: hi Dan hey everybody i'm Jamie lesinski i'm the Managing Director of Los Angeles USA for renewables offshore for offer engineering and energy group.

220
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:40.470
Jamie Lescinski: And we are constructing wind farms all over the world and i've had the pleasure of also being our project manager, a number of years ago for the 3D printer grief monocle pilot project.

221
00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:55.950
Jamie Lescinski: And, and so what i'm going to show today are a few things that we've been doing and basically how we deal with this was in boy scouts which is like the little sort of microcosm version of how you need to deal with it and the big in the big picture act so next slide.

222
00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:05.520
Jamie Lescinski: So value of artificial reefs, basically, the way we see it, and the way we work with it on our various projects.

223
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:11.250
Jamie Lescinski: Which are pilot projects are basically can be independent of development, and we also have projects.

224
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:19.260
Jamie Lescinski: For example, as marcella just showed and as drew showed that are part of bigger developments so both are valuable.

225
00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:25.680
Jamie Lescinski: And DC with artificial reefs you see that they yeah they play an interesting role with habitat creation their scale home.

226
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:31.050
Jamie Lescinski: And that you need to basically work with your site specific ecology and ocean conditions.

227
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:38.130
Jamie Lescinski: And that they basically can support fisheries development, they can serve as coastal protection and also enhance biodiversity.

228
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:43.650
Jamie Lescinski: They can create interconnectivity so again as drew mentioned really looking at that connectivity element.

229
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:54.270
Jamie Lescinski: which you can look at wind farms as a way of basically connecting different habitats or creating a broader habitat within a wind farm by through through pathways of connectivity.

230
00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:05.760
Jamie Lescinski: and restoration elements, you can also consider restoration, where you know that there's already been historical degradation, or you might even close degradation So how do you deal with restoration.

231
00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:19.230
Jamie Lescinski: Are off setting and then also creating opportunities for research and Community involvement, the world for you, Sir, far from perfectly understood so there's a lot for us to learn next slide.

232
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:29.190
Jamie Lescinski: So offshore wind farms, we see them actually has presented unique opportunities, but in order to be able to seize those opportunities, you have to connect.

233
00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:34.770
Jamie Lescinski: You basically can't take it from one perspective, both drew and again Marcel.

234
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:43.230
Jamie Lescinski: touched upon elements were looking at it from an ecological perspective or from an engineering perspective, they actually could be contrary conflicting to each other.

235
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:49.980
Jamie Lescinski: Again, from a governance perspective, but basically in order to be able to have successful project moving forward, you need to look at.

236
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:58.890
Jamie Lescinski: What you want to develop why you want to develop it and you need to look at it from these different perspectives and enter to a fashion, where you basically are combining.

237
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:09.180
Jamie Lescinski: Including common goals and basically you're avoiding negative subsequent impacts through governance engineering and ecology.

238
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:16.860
Jamie Lescinski: And again, everybody brings their own knowledge into it, so you can't do it alone, you need to basically have these Community efforts.

239
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:22.740
Jamie Lescinski: Where you need to be lean and efficient, especially within developments themselves wind farm developments.

240
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:30.390
Jamie Lescinski: Also big see how Anthony was describing recently trying to you know utilize the wind farm that's going to be development developed anyway.

241
00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:46.290
Jamie Lescinski: But then bringing this extra opportunity in for research and better understanding ecological research and better understanding by basically working together with clients fisheries government contractors knowledge institute's and NGOs next slide.

242
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:55.380
Jamie Lescinski: So for ourselves what we've learned we've been basically working with artificial reefs around a decade as well scarless.

243
00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:06.390
Jamie Lescinski: Through projects as through are basically the infrastructure mean infrastructure that we're developing or alongside or even independent from our projects.

244
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:18.030
Jamie Lescinski: But basically reef development and re projects and it's an integral part, you need to have sustainable design where you're combining all aspects, so that I noted, to have a win, win.

245
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:32.520
Jamie Lescinski: You need to have basically as compensation rehabilitation you to look at ecosystem values, but also within the governance systems do you actually have to work with permit systems or utilize these projects as.

246
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:47.520
Jamie Lescinski: As mechanisms to actually enable permitting processes and there's also value in these individual standalone system developments, especially from a research perspective and development of sanctuaries.

247
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:55.920
Jamie Lescinski: This is also quite important, when looking at decision making associated with how and where you develop your structures, both Anthony and.

248
00:43:56.730 --> 00:44:05.910
Jamie Lescinski: Marcel showed two different approaches also drew where basically you're looking at you can look at developments that are directly attached to or focused on.

249
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:14.940
Jamie Lescinski: The Marine infrastructure itself that's going in the water, but you can also look at it as being independent from those structures are trying to utilize those structures.

250
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:22.410
Jamie Lescinski: where you have the reef itself being developed nearby, and this is quite important from the perspective of decommissioning.

251
00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:27.090
Jamie Lescinski: If you know you have to take that structure, out of the water and 25 years or 50 years from now.

252
00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:33.300
Jamie Lescinski: You need to be really aware of, do you want to actually develop your restructure on the structure, you need to remove later.

253
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:39.720
Jamie Lescinski: By permit or Development next to it, or do you have the right to leave it in the water, if you develop a reef system there.

254
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:51.060
Jamie Lescinski: So these are all big picture long term ways of thinking, but are really important in order to be able to define the success of the project, so you need to think on the total lifetime of the project.

255
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:59.520
Jamie Lescinski: For our approach basically we work again within our projects, as well as via pilots, the network is hugely important.

256
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:07.890
Jamie Lescinski: We would never be successful in any of our reef pilots doing it alone or even just working only with our clients, we always have to leverage knowledge and.

257
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:22.350
Jamie Lescinski: resources from the Community to make it successful and also really focusing on this positive impact the positive impact, again, is to can't be just from one perspective, it has to be multi multi perspective and next slide please.

258
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:36.060
Jamie Lescinski: So, here are some of the different concepts that we've tested globally, so far, so we've worked with really tailor made 3D printed structures So these are very large scale, these are two meters wide a meter and a half tall.

259
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:46.950
Jamie Lescinski: And these are BC tailored to the system at hand they're unique, but they are expensive, you have to transport them carefully.

260
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:59.430
Jamie Lescinski: And they're they're not necessarily transferable directly in design or concept to other locations, there are a modular systems so we're working with reef systems by roses.

261
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:06.840
Jamie Lescinski: And this roof systems and repeat blocks, and these are all systems where you basically through the modular approach you build it.

262
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:07.260
up.

263
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.670
Jamie Lescinski: To the unique system and then develop it in that way.

264
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:24.690
Jamie Lescinski: And they have other yeah they basically have other advantages and disadvantages so again there's not one design one material that is perfect for any system and you need to basically taken into into consideration, be aware.

265
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:39.360
Jamie Lescinski: And that there are huge developments going on all the time with materials and so to leverage the state of the art leverage the knowledge that's out there to basically build the best artificial reef system for your specific system.

266
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:41.400
Jamie Lescinski: And next slide.

267
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:52.860
Jamie Lescinski: So for our program bcp overall our goals is the development application of large scale artificial reefs as enablers for marine infrastructure or coastal protection works.

268
00:46:53.220 --> 00:47:00.000
Jamie Lescinski: that's the nature of our business so that's the connection to our business our strategy is that article artificial reefs directly address.

269
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:09.330
Jamie Lescinski: Our focus areas of biodiversity and climate change mitigation and that we're looking to provide the artificial solutions, but with a clear business.

270
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:18.720
Jamie Lescinski: We are, we are a business green infrastructure contracting business, so we need to be so, you make a connection to our business for all of the activities that were involved in.

271
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:37.620
Jamie Lescinski: And then, our approach again i've already said it so strong strategic partnerships build upon symbiotic dynamics to make sure you have win wins for all parties and you're not negatively impacting another aspect because of really focusing on one particular vote one area.

272
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:46.200
Jamie Lescinski: And that basically really leverage the different types of systems that are out there to serve our clients and our markets and then last slide.

273
00:47:48.120 --> 00:48:02.160
Jamie Lescinski: This is just an example of some of the parties that we've worked with really closely to make to basically develop some of the artificial reef pilots and projects that we've worked on, to date, this isn't even comprehensive, but it really it takes a village to do it successfully and.

274
00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:11.040
Daniel Kuchma: Jamie Thank you ever so much, and thank you to all the speakers in this first part, I found you know I think it's inspiring it's impressive.

275
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:24.960
Daniel Kuchma: So much leadership being shown Thank you Rebecca and mark for summarizing the synthesis work, which is also critical since the US is a little bit earlier in this, which is fantastic things to do even in national labs obviously for that.

276
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:36.000
Daniel Kuchma: to bomb in the rodeo project that drew summarize some of the great work happening on you know, on the first wind farm in the US block island and now continuing in Virginia as well that's exciting.

277
00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:41.580
Daniel Kuchma: Anthony and Marcel for a lot of boots on the ground, actually getting in and tagging.

278
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:53.160
Daniel Kuchma: Fishing following the lobsters and everything else, and so that's obviously very important for critical in industries and Jamie, thank you for expressing what is needed from a collaboration.

279
00:48:54.150 --> 00:49:01.650
Daniel Kuchma: approach in order to actually being able to deliver something that is a success for all the most pertinent groups.

280
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:09.690
Daniel Kuchma: So, part two of the meeting today we're going to look at some topics that are much more specific to what is.

281
00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:21.240
Daniel Kuchma: We have to deliver on for this bone project and so we're going to get the we have 15 minutes for each of these four groups of speakers and so Monica let's go start off right off with you.

282
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:34.680
Monica.Maher: Thanks Dan so i'm working as a contractor with the Department of energy's wind office, but today i'm going to talk about a field study I did a few years ago, well, it.

283
00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:53.850
Monica.Maher: Florida tech um this project is written up in materials performance magazine corrosion control and ecosystems enhancement with offshore mana piles and we also receive the honor of a materials performance innovation of the year award i'm so diving next slide.

284
00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:11.250
Monica.Maher: So, as we already heard i'm in the project background, there was the original thought of not having active corrosion protection in mana pile interiors but it found that there was oxygen ingress and then there was a.

285
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:32.460
Monica.Maher: trial and an RC that Alex down which wrote about that they retrofitted aluminum and nodes in an existing mana pile and that case experienced hydrogen sulfide formation and water, certification and that chemistry presents a risk for unique approach and concerns next slide.

286
00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:55.470
Monica.Maher: So for my small field trial, the hypotheses were that a perforated structure could create environment with more favorable corrosion mitigation air quality and water chemistry compared to a sealed one and that a perforated structure will create a habitat for marine life next slide.

287
00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:08.760
Monica.Maher: So in my experiment I deploy one meter long steel pipes which represented scale down mana piles and I put steel coupons inside for convenient analysis.

288
00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:20.070
Monica.Maher: It for treatments, including to seal pipes into perforated ones so within each pair I had a really corroding pipe and a pathetically protected protected pipe with a zinc sacrificial anode.

289
00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:30.570
Monica.Maher: So the sealed unprotected treatment represents originally installed when when farms field protected is similar to the North Sea case study previously described.

290
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:37.650
Monica.Maher: And a perforated pathetically protected treatment over on the right is considered in my child is a potential improved at nine.

291
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.480
Monica.Maher: So here's how the pipes looked um they're deployed.

292
00:51:47.310 --> 00:52:01.290
Monica.Maher: from August to October 1 2018 it a port canaveral so they're hung on a floating dock with a bit of a air gap at the top and some local mud was put at the bottom to kind of represent a driven pile.

293
00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:05.280
Monica.Maher: And the wires You see, there are for corrosion measurements.

294
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:09.720
Monica.Maher: So the measurements.

295
00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:22.800
Monica.Maher: During deployment were dissolved oxygen pH because added protection and corrosion rates and, at the end of deployment the weight loss of the steel was observed and the habitat development with.

296
00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:25.290
Monica.Maher: Nick.

297
00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:28.830
Monica.Maher: So, looking at the dissolved oxygen measurements.

298
00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:37.380
Monica.Maher: The black line shows oxygen levels of seawater the port fluctuate a bit on a daily cycle to do with biological activity.

299
00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:47.700
Monica.Maher: And the blue and purple lines show how dissolved oxygen quickly reduced in the sealed pipes which was in line with that theory of oxygen getting consumed during initial corrosion.

300
00:52:48.390 --> 00:53:02.670
Monica.Maher: And the red and yellow lines are the perforated pipes, you can see the match that of the ambient seawater in the first month and the bit of a decrease in the second month might be explained by the growing biological Community inside the pipes consuming oxygen.

301
00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:17.160
Monica.Maher: And next looking at pH so the black line just the ambient seawater stays near neutral pH of eight and the blue line shows the field unprotected treatment.

302
00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:26.400
Monica.Maher: which the pH actually increased a bit after the oxygen was reduced and the purple line shows acidification occurred in the steel pipe was link.

303
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:38.370
Monica.Maher: So that was similar to the North Sea trial with the aluminum and nodes and aluminum in aqua solution can form complex ions that cause acidification, reducing pH down to four.

304
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:50.400
Monica.Maher: and similarly thinking an aqua solution may put the electrolyte pH down to 6.8 and that i'm theoretically calculated equilibrium pH was consistent with.

305
00:53:51.150 --> 00:54:05.970
Monica.Maher: The pH value is measured industry this experiment with them 6.8 and the red and yellow lines to show that the perforated pipes maintain the pH similar to ambien see water in your neutrals and it's expected and then next slide.

306
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.120
Monica.Maher: shows what we saw.

307
00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:19.350
Monica.Maher: Inside the pipes at the end of the experiment so in the steel pipes there's i'm black and orange corrosion products on the freely quoting treatment and the.

308
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:36.030
Monica.Maher: pathetically protected treatment had heavy chalking and in the perforated pipes there's file failing and Trojan products on the freely quoting treatment and there was file felling adhere to a healthy steel on the perforated cathartic Lee protected treatment.

309
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:41.130
Monica.Maher: So next i'm starting to focus on the habitat.

310
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:47.910
Monica.Maher: During my weekly visits I had some indication that there was a.

311
00:54:49.950 --> 00:55:05.010
Monica.Maher: organisms starting to hang out inside the pipes, you can see a crab here crawling into one of the perforations when there was a fish plucking out of another one, and then next to look at at the end of deployment what was inside the pipes, though.

312
00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.160
Monica.Maher: At the time of removing the pipes from the water.

313
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:21.180
Monica.Maher: In the perforated unprotected pipe there were mobile animals, including a snapper and a few crabs and again the steel was covered in kind of diverse bio failing, as well as them voluminous rest.

314
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:34.890
Monica.Maher: And I just one quick and looking at the bottom cap of this pipe where had the originally placed mud, and then, as well as the layer of decaying bio failing on top.

315
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:50.700
Monica.Maher: And some fresh bio family top that had kind of recently slough off the sides of the pipe there, you can see, one of the sea squirts has some kind of bright orange rust on it, so this kind of implied on sustained growth, as well as.

316
00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:52.950
Monica.Maher: A big risk of field loss as the.

317
00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.320
Monica.Maher: Bio telling them.

318
00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:56.610
Monica.Maher: follows often reveals the.

319
00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:02.610
Monica.Maher: new layer of steel so next looks at the protected pipe.

320
00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:04.770
Monica.Maher: So in there.

321
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:22.350
Monica.Maher: The there were more mobile organisms that kind of a higher population count and the steel surfaces were covered in diverse i'll fouling it here to like a healthy steel and in the bottom CAP it had the originally placed mud, and there are also a few extra.

322
00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:28.260
Monica.Maher: kind of animals hiding in there with one more quick can be.

323
00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.680
Monica.Maher: Add those to the collection so.

324
00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.510
Monica.Maher: A lot of life in that one and then next.

325
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:47.490
Monica.Maher: kind of compares the habitats of the the two perforated pipes, so there was there was kind of a greater population and more biodiversity of.

326
00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:56.250
Monica.Maher: Of the mobile organisms in the pathetically protected pipe and abundant bio failing on on both of the perforated pipes.

327
00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:01.530
Monica.Maher: And so next to the conclusions of this small study.

328
00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:11.850
Monica.Maher: showed that a perforated mountain pile interior walls can more easily and predictably be correct be protected from corrosion with sonic protection.

329
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:21.870
Monica.Maher: And that can be protected perforated mana piles can enhance the ecology of a region by providing a sheltered space within which the Green organisms.

330
00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:30.780
Monica.Maher: tend to be attracted to and prosper and that nature inclusive engineering offers opportunity to compliment the local environment and provide ecosystem services.

331
00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:32.040
Like.

332
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:39.300
Daniel Kuchma: Monica Thank you very much for sharing that great pioneering work that I know you and Jeff did essentially with no budget so that's.

333
00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:50.250
Daniel Kuchma: Two particular so i'm just staying on that one john is great, and we do have like time, maybe six minutes for a little bit of Q amp a if someone has questions for Monica.

334
00:57:54.120 --> 00:58:03.540
Daniel Kuchma: And if you do a question, maybe you know raise your hand and then I think I will see it turn your video camera on that's often helpful.

335
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:18.060
Daniel Kuchma: everybody's been, including their questions and chat we will, at the end of the session i'm thinking probably have close to 15 minutes for a little bit more of an open discussion based on what everybody's heard today.

336
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:28.650
Daniel Kuchma: So, if you prefer to save your question until we are farther along that's good as well, but i'll wait another 30 seconds or so, to see if anybody has a question.

337
00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.790
Monica.Maher: I can keep an eye on the chat again.

338
00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:59.850
Daniel Kuchma: Monica I think everybody knows there's quite a bit to get into, and so what we'll do is we'll move along then to Andrew and if we end up having our collective discussion at the end that's probably a good way to do things as well, but thank you once again for sharing the great work Andrew.

339
00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:19.530
Andrew Want: I everyone, my name is Andrew i'm from Harry what university, where I do research and bio fouling and dan's asked me today to provide a kind of an overview of fire falling in relationship to the sector, so I can have the next slide please.

340
00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:25.590
Andrew Want: i'm based i've been opening, which is an archipelago of the north coast of Scotland.

341
00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:41.880
Andrew Want: And I was very quiet very well university but we're also very close to the European marine energy Center where they are testing and developing wave entitled devices and waters, very close to us are also, of course, commercial scale deployment of.

342
00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:54.600
Andrew Want: Offshore fixed and floating wind turbines so on the next slide quick introduction to buy o'fallon it's the settlement and growth of organisms as soon as you put something in the water.

343
00:59:55.140 --> 01:00:03.300
Andrew Want: By fouling occurs almost instantaneously as from a chemical standpoint, the very second you play something water, there are thoughts become.

344
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:18.840
Andrew Want: chemical reactions very quickly bacteria settled to this a SLIME forms and that facilitates the growth of the settlement, excuse me, and then the growth of of larger organisms superficially is divided into micro fouling and macro failing.

345
01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:32.910
Andrew Want: These are often you're a specialist in these different areas microphones are very, very important topic it's essential in the overall fouling understanding, however, what i'll be talking about in my own.

346
01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:39.810
Andrew Want: specialization is in macro felling so we'll be talking more about that topic they kept the next slide Thank you.

347
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.670
Andrew Want: So what is the problem with bio family, what is it doing well.

348
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:55.710
Andrew Want: As may have your costs are interested in in this topic today it's it costs to accelerate corrosion and, of course, then leads to you know, a lack of survivability of components, etc.

349
01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:07.290
Andrew Want: But the other impacts of bio fouling include it's increasing roughness or the structure which increases drags you didn't get increasing drag forces which may be relevant for example morning systems, etc.

350
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:14.010
Andrew Want: Increased weight as well in the morning Saturday morning systems and dynamic subsea cables especially.

351
01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:23.970
Andrew Want: The the strategies for dealing with fouling and removing fouling are expensive and it caused a lot of downtime so there's economic consequences as well.

352
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:31.620
Andrew Want: They can file access areas, so making safety issues with with, for example, where you know, a boarding boarding onto a structure for example.

353
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:46.260
Andrew Want: They can be specific falling on to animals and on coatings this can then also accelerate corrosion with that and I do want to talk about that there is an ecological issues which have been touched upon by our earliest speakers and.

354
01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:52.800
Andrew Want: Answer water by those little bit later on now, you may be thinking, but.

355
01:01:53.040 --> 01:02:03.240
Andrew Want: Surely we already understand by our founding we have the oil and gas sector and sure there are the surrogate industries with routing learn love information from them and have learned love and affection from them.

356
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:08.280
Andrew Want: But there are some limitations associated with these So if I had the next slide please.

357
01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:21.360
Andrew Want: Is this a new problem by our founding well, there are some unique issues with offshore renewable energy so specifically we're using new components and new materials which may not have been previously been tested.

358
01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:30.750
Andrew Want: properly in the marine environment and gone through its paces devices are being placed in habitats that maybe have not been studied as well.

359
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:34.350
Andrew Want: areas are very, very high energy, for example.

360
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:46.320
Andrew Want: we're using and also passed a world where we may not have done previous studies we're also using very narrow, in some cases very narrow down to structures and especially thinking about floating.

361
01:02:47.100 --> 01:03:00.810
Andrew Want: window here with with dynamic subsea cables and morning systems also use loving increased use of sensors now for detecting resource assessment of performance, so there are some unique problems with biofilms like how the next slide.

362
01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:09.750
Andrew Want: So one of the one of the main factors which affect fouling from one place to another well, let me just quickly go through these but don't have time to go in much detail.

363
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:18.480
Andrew Want: But depth is a big issue and that's often are largely related to the amount of food again energy coming down so plants Alan you can look at the top, but not deep water.

364
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:27.360
Andrew Want: Yesterday, other issues oxygenation occupation, etc temperatures a big factoring type of fat fallon community, the type of substrate.

365
01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:38.850
Andrew Want: As well our hydrological processes, as well as hydrodynamic processes will affect the type of value that you get other other in other parts of water chemistry.

366
01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:48.060
Andrew Want: Important distance from land is important and also distance reports are important that's especially important when it comes to vessel transfer of organisms.

367
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:58.560
Andrew Want: from biological standpoint, there are factors such as competition successful processes and seasonality, which can cause differences and changes within the type of fouling.

368
01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:09.090
Andrew Want: organisms that you get so as an overall if you sum it all up together, where you also get, of course, he said, there are huge geographic differences, so they have the next slide.

369
01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:24.330
Andrew Want: The earth humans love to create an pigeonhole stuff so the earth has been divided into these various different eco regions from from a marine standpoint in this is fairly near shore areas I run that on the next slide.

370
01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:37.380
Andrew Want: These have been come subs we shorted into into other ones, and some of these areas have been very well studied so, for example, number 25 the North Sea is very well studied maybe 43 the Gulf of Mexico is.

371
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:48.540
Andrew Want: A very well studied area as well, the eastern seaboard of the US, maybe a little bit less so, and certainly some parts of the world are probably very relatively poorly studied, so I can have the next slide please.

372
01:04:50.910 --> 01:05:02.910
Andrew Want: So some of the major macro failing groups that you find in the North Sea, I don't have time to go through these and many vehicles we're very familiar with these types of organisms, but here's a bit of a you know, a gallery of some of the main types of organisms.

373
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:12.990
Andrew Want: And if I can have the next slide we have a listing of organisms suddenly they're found in the Northwest Atlantic so on the eastern seaboard of the US.

374
01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:20.370
Andrew Want: And again they're often quite similar organisms, maybe different species, but quite similar In fact I got the next slide.

375
01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:26.670
Andrew Want: This just continues on with this list of them, so, so we have a pretty good idea for certain regions, what type of organisms you're going to.

376
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.440
Andrew Want: you're going to get and we have some idea of what kind of impact these organisms will be as well.

377
01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:37.500
Andrew Want: But I want to talk a little bit more detail about some of these environmental factors that I previously mentioned, so if if the next slide.

378
01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:46.320
Andrew Want: yeah so latitude no gradient is important one, well, so what this is showing here, this is quite an early diagram from from from studies of what all.

379
01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:56.730
Andrew Want: He is a you get all the latitude and or gradients of where organisms will survive and where they live, so as you travel from a north, south access you'll start to experience that are shifting.

380
01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:05.700
Andrew Want: Shifting baseline the major by the valley organisms in those regions so it's not it's not rocket science, of course, but it's just illustrating that fact.

381
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:21.120
Andrew Want: The next one is depth gradient so this this study here is showing some oil and gas jackets have been studying in the North Sea and kind of the take home point without getting into huge detail is just that in different depths, you have different prioritization.

382
01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:32.580
Andrew Want: That flight word different characters you there is a different characterization of of species which become more dominant so different depths and I guess and take on point of this is that you can characterize this.

383
01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:41.400
Andrew Want: You can you can recognize patterns associated with depth, but you can also be aware of the three locations you'll be differences in the in the relative.

384
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:56.310
Andrew Want: Relative ratio of these different organisms so next slide please, this is another way of showing depth gradient as well, this is from 14 1982 and again it's looking at both inside and outside of these jackets.

385
01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:06.150
Andrew Want: And, and the abundance of it so again association changes in these values associated with depth as we go through some kind of next slide.

386
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:18.360
Andrew Want: lot of the work that I do is looking at extreme exposure environments so hydro dynamics are also very, very important in types of buyer family communities, so what this MDS plot is showing here.

387
01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:35.250
Andrew Want: Is that, in this case, there are three main clusters of bio failing communities that are associated with sheltered harbor Marina type environments versus high wave environments versus high title flow environment, so these again, these are critical.

388
01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:40.260
Andrew Want: environmental factors that determine the type of organisms you get falling onto.

389
01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.400
Andrew Want: A structure so for the next slide please.

390
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:51.360
Andrew Want: Just to briefly talk about seasonality, so it probably is no surprise that there are certain seasons, I should say, there are certain.

391
01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:55.290
Andrew Want: Specific organism have certain seasons, that they are typically will grow at.

392
01:07:55.650 --> 01:08:05.430
Andrew Want: An angle settle, so I will settle regrow their level sporting seasons are different, so this is showing this is being tracked through locations here in woods hole and Chesapeake bay.

393
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:23.970
Andrew Want: So you can have some kind of idea of what species you'd expect at a certain time, if I can have the next slide so so what we've done here in America, this time I visualized is this comm traffic light system is that with this kind of information, you might be able to manage timings of.

394
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:35.010
Andrew Want: scheduled maintenance to maximize the efficiency of of your fouling medications, for example, but yeah the next slide.

395
01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:40.590
Andrew Want: So the other process when mentioned in succession so just like the forest which.

396
01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:51.660
Andrew Want: goes through various stages until it reaches the climax you get the same situation with putting a brand new hot substrate into the sea, there is a process of successful changes which go on so.

397
01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:56.760
Andrew Want: And I should point out to the world what season you put it in will affect that succession.

398
01:08:57.090 --> 01:09:09.150
Andrew Want: So in this particular case on the diagram the right, we see that very early on succession, you have high droids in deep water in the shallow water, you have algae and then, as it progresses over time there is a replacement of one.

399
01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:15.720
Andrew Want: Dominant organism by another until you reach 10 this status which which.

400
01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:23.220
Andrew Want: can vary the very the stability of it varies depending on other environmental conditions if I go the next slide please.

401
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:33.900
Andrew Want: So just to go back into it when we're looking at the impacts and some of the ecology as well, from a practical standpoint, we try to understand bio fouling maybe it's impacts.

402
01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:43.440
Andrew Want: The key takeaway I think I have here is that if you look at this dmv standard which is for wind turbines it gives quite a crude estimate of.

403
01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:57.090
Andrew Want: This figure of 1300 kilograms per cubic meter of fouling but from all the research they've taken for the standard this table at the bottom there indicates very, very, very crudely just simply two deaths.

404
01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:07.020
Andrew Want: Up to 40 meters and then down below 40 meters and then a second one of the locations which is central North Sea and no agency.

405
01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:20.580
Andrew Want: So there's no references to substrates or references different species rain lightness so my point being that, as of right now we there are many, many gaps knowledge knowledge gaps in this and the the standardization in the industry is quite.

406
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:29.610
Andrew Want: blunt or this or this or this or this point partially, because there is a lot of variation sometimes between locations so then go to the next slide please.

407
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:35.460
Andrew Want: I want to just to end by talking about the ecological impacts of by providing substrate habitat.

408
01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:40.590
Andrew Want: So this has been touched on by some of our other speakers today so.

409
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:51.420
Andrew Want: Firstly, by placing structures in the sea, you can enhance biodiversity you're creating more complex substrates of greater variety of substrates.

410
01:10:52.200 --> 01:11:05.070
Andrew Want: And, but or I should say, in addition to that these may serve as I think as Julie mentioned that stepping stones, which can then facility, the movement of organisms from one space to another place now, these can be perceived possibly it's good.

411
01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:14.010
Andrew Want: quotations or bad quotations it might be an organism that you want to settle there, like a rare heart coral, for example.

412
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:20.490
Andrew Want: But it could also be yeah it could be something that's not a state, but it could be an invasive non native species which you are.

413
01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:32.070
Andrew Want: Promoting it spread, because you are giving it substrates by which to move upon in addition to that service vessels may work as as soon as as as a conduit for further spread of these organisms so on the next.

414
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:38.580
Andrew Want: slide things might my last slide or loss of to just I so i've been looking this is working in all the research.

415
01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:44.610
Andrew Want: We found there are several non native species that are found in the harbors and marinas in our waters.

416
01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:55.980
Andrew Want: i'm I guess i'm happy to report to say that the full scale test centers or title and wave environments, are very high exposure conditions there have been no non native species.

417
01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:01.650
Andrew Want: recorded so maybe that they're Hydra graphic barriers that are created by.

418
01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:13.170
Andrew Want: In more exposed conditions which will where we might be finding like offshore wind deployments as well, so that's that's maybe you know something to keep our fingers crossed about and I think i've just one last slide.

419
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:24.150
Andrew Want: And that is to say yeah, so there are many, many knowledge gaps which existing bio fouling in the offshore renewable energy sector, so, in particular, we don't understand the environments that well.

420
01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:34.230
Andrew Want: That they're they're less studied, I should say, and there are parts of the world, certainly weather very, very, very understudied where we don't understand the founding can you read near as well as as Tom areas.

421
01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:41.580
Andrew Want: There are materials niche areas that are unique to these industries that are not as well understood as.

422
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:55.590
Andrew Want: As for example, more established oil and gas gas and then again the overall risk assessment of the role of the structures in connectivity and then allowing ins to Detroit to facilitate I NS.

423
01:12:56.070 --> 01:13:05.130
Andrew Want: These of non native species transmission is a concern, so there are organizations like blow fouling which are trying to understand this and trying to.

424
01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:22.200
Andrew Want: just get a better understanding of the risks associated with this industry so that's that's if my as a whirlwind will wind exploration of bio founding there's an email address down there to serve you have any questions i'll look at them in the chat, but please do contact me as well.

425
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:33.480
Daniel Kuchma: Andrew Thank you ever so much for that incredibly informative and you got through that material at an amazing pace, but also with great clarity, so thank you very much for that.

426
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:45.420
Daniel Kuchma: Does anybody have a question that they'd like to ask, Andrew right now, if not, what we'll do is for sort of then save the time at the end so, then we can have questions to any of the people that are presented, thus far.

427
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:50.820
Daniel Kuchma: But if someone does have a question on some recently presented material that be, we can take that now.

428
01:13:55.350 --> 01:14:12.720
Daniel Kuchma: Andrew I think everybody's going to wait until the end, please do ask your questions by chat etc, and we will do our best in the minutes to provide responses to those questions, so please do that and so next we're over to a Nick and stuff on.

429
01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:15.840
Peter Schaumann: there.

430
01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:20.700
Peter Schaumann: Then, are you allowing one question.

431
01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:22.200
Daniel Kuchma: Yes, Peter go ahead.

432
01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:32.760
Peter Schaumann: i'm interested in the question on whether you have quantitative data concerning the Marine row thickness over the year.

433
01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:36.990
Daniel Kuchma: And you're I think.

434
01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:39.900
Peter Schaumann: Anybody have information about that.

435
01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:45.000
Andrew Want: So the question is on regrow thickness has developed over the over over time.

436
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:46.140
Peter Schaumann: over time.

437
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:55.530
Andrew Want: yeah absolutely yeah so yeah I do have, I do have some of those data from from the from the area that i've studied they do exist for other other other projects as well.

438
01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:03.630
Andrew Want: That D amp D standard that I showed towards the end of the talk that that we're showing estimates of thickness again for those.

439
01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:16.770
Andrew Want: After that did the point I was making on that slide was that it does show the estimates of finances for depth and also for two regions within kind of North Sea and the Agency, but again they're very, very, very broad.

440
01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:20.430
Andrew Want: So yeah they they do, they do exist, to some degree.

441
01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:29.820
Andrew Want: And there are a lot of additional factors in it, it does depend on what species, they are so, is it an interesting species, or is it a.

442
01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:31.770
Andrew Want: sort of a.

443
01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.140
Andrew Want: More compliant organism, as far as if you're talking about the effects, for example on flow.

444
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:44.640
Andrew Want: So yeah it can be quite complex but yes those they do exist, but they are, they are quite varied between locations.

445
01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:47.430
Peter Schaumann: Okay, thank you.

446
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:57.540
Daniel Kuchma: Peter Peter what we'll do is, I think, through the questions, etc, and Andrew will maybe with yourself and with some others if people can actually identify references if someone.

447
01:15:57.810 --> 01:16:05.490
Daniel Kuchma: wants to look at some of this material in greater detail, we can work on sharing that so thank you very much, and so over to you neck.

448
01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:24.540
bruinsma: yeah thanks, then, and also thanks Andrew because I think it's a it's a very relevant topic i'd also comes back to in one of my slides the effect of marine growth actually on hydrodynamic um but today, Stephen and I will talk you through.

449
01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:32.910
bruinsma: Basically delta versus approach to growth and protection and water an Arab management in offshore wind menopause.

450
01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:39.180
bruinsma: i'll do part of the slides than stephen's taking over, and then I will I will wrap it up.

451
01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:41.610
bruinsma: Can you go to the next slide please.

452
01:16:44.370 --> 01:17:06.300
bruinsma: So I think this is already briefly touch upon, but what we can do in terms of mitigation of corrosion inside of these offshore structures is apply coatings and either apply sacrificial and outs zinc Romanian or an ICP system and i'll talk about the pros and cons or the the alternatives.

453
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:11.580
bruinsma: In the in the next slide if you can please go to the next one.

454
01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:16.050
bruinsma: um so.

455
01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:27.180
bruinsma: Before actually going to what these systems do to the environment is a question I posed linking to the first part of this.

456
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:30.210
bruinsma: session is can we.

457
01:17:31.650 --> 01:17:53.160
bruinsma: make these designs more nature, inclusive, so, taking into account the nature and what what nature needs to to thrive we've already seen quite a couple of very beautiful pictures of either fish or lobster or muscles I think even even seals are popping up close to wind farms.

458
01:17:54.630 --> 01:18:01.380
bruinsma: And the questions that we we asked herself as to improve nature inclusive design, can we.

459
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:20.850
bruinsma: Have a limitation of large scale impacts, such as, for instance, the noise, but you can also think of the shedding of sinker and minium with metals into the MID into the environment, and what does this do for the for the marine environment.

460
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:25.260
bruinsma: I think we've also we've also heard talks about.

461
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:39.420
bruinsma: restoration of historical species, but also preventing invasive species to come to these places, and by that also increasing bio bio diversity or enhancing it.

462
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:46.800
bruinsma: And I think for that it's really important to both measure and model.

463
01:18:48.240 --> 01:19:00.390
bruinsma: Different types of environmental conditions like the temperature maybe the salinity is important we've heard oxygen levels are very important for for marine life.

464
01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:12.450
bruinsma: And while there are various models that we can we can use to model these these parameters, but of course they also need to be quantified with measurements of the, off the field.

465
01:19:13.530 --> 01:19:14.340
bruinsma: Next slide please.

466
01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:26.250
bruinsma: And then I would like to give it over to Stephen who's going to tell you a bit more on the effects of sacrificial I know it's an ICP.

467
01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:28.260
stefan jansen: Yes, thank you, Nick.

468
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:32.700
stefan jansen: Yes, I will briefly touch upon the internal.

469
01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.470
stefan jansen: chemistry of menopause.

470
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:43.920
stefan jansen: Because it was already described before, especially by Monica very nicely in a presentation that the inside of the mono files can have a very.

471
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:49.350
stefan jansen: distinct chemical nature, and especially the effect of.

472
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:58.920
stefan jansen: Quality protection is very important, and the effect of sacrificial and outs can be zinc or aluminum emissions.

473
01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:03.510
stefan jansen: This can of course be toxic, the question is.

474
01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:12.240
stefan jansen: To what extent that really is the case in in practice, I think that is really an interesting research question.

475
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:30.810
stefan jansen: On the other hand, if you have I speed systems, instead of sacrificial and outs, then different types of phenomena occur, first of all, the pH close to the animals can drop, whereas the pH longer steel surface.

476
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:36.750
stefan jansen: rises and this can create related.

477
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:56.700
stefan jansen: effects and also when the potential system is not well fine tunes guess formation can occur, especially chloride and roll mine, which can in their part, be converted to other species which can have deteriorated effects.

478
01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:03.090
stefan jansen: Well, and while there is some knowledge on the internal of mono files.

479
01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:05.220
stefan jansen: I hear I give an example from.

480
01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:09.360
stefan jansen: From literature, maybe next slide can be shown.

481
01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.540
stefan jansen: Yes, thank you.

482
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:18.780
stefan jansen: hear the right stop show some well schematic.

483
01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:24.570
stefan jansen: profiles for a couple of important chemical.

484
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:31.530
stefan jansen: physical parameters such as temperature oxygen conductivity.

485
01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:46.380
stefan jansen: So something is known about these parameters, however, the obtaining of local and measurement information can be quite a challenge in these environments and, of course, this is a very important.

486
01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:50.310
stefan jansen: thing to do so more obtaining more.

487
01:21:52.110 --> 01:22:05.070
stefan jansen: monitoring data is very important and then of course oxygen was already mentioned a couple of times, which is very important parameter, it was thoughts.

488
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:19.920
stefan jansen: For some time, that inside a close mono pile oxygen would quickly go to zero, it was not as black and white is dead in many cases, there was some leakage or transport.

489
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:32.550
stefan jansen: scene and there's a lot of data, which shows also that in many cases oxygen doesn't go don't go to zero easily enclosed system systems.

490
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:34.500
stefan jansen: However.

491
01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:47.580
stefan jansen: Another important issue is also not not only to look into the overall bulk of the internal mana power but also look into certain niches.

492
01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:59.430
stefan jansen: Such as near the sea floor or other anaerobic niches where very specific locations can occur or oxygen can really be dictated to zero.

493
01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:17.910
stefan jansen: And, of course, here I show a picture or orange shown by Monica which very nicely shows that if you have depletion of oxygen replenishment halls can be an interesting option to to counteract next slide please.

494
01:23:20.730 --> 01:23:28.620
stefan jansen: And I think this slides nicely relates to what Andrew wants shouts very nicely on all kinds of bio founding.

495
01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:43.800
stefan jansen: Why i'm a microbiologist myself and I amongst other I look at to corrosion also a mono files and there you see that inside the mono files and especially along still you can have all kinds of.

496
01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:56.130
stefan jansen: Micronesia is where microorganisms like to colonize and eventually leads to the the other bio fouling processes that Andrew described very nicely.

497
01:23:56.610 --> 01:24:04.710
stefan jansen: And what is very interesting, I think, is that you really also here, you have to look at the different niches aerobic anaerobic.

498
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:16.920
stefan jansen: but also different environments see water settlements sands and also the steel service itself can be very specific chemical environments, which leads to very specific growth.

499
01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:32.490
stefan jansen: And if you look at the organisms that you find there at the bottom graph shows to analyses of findings in laboratory setting where we took reactors with seawater.

500
01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:53.580
stefan jansen: And there you can see that you will find a variety of micro micro organisms there, and also, if you compare the Left and the Right graph you see a difference when you go to the sea water or to still surface in sc was are the specific.

501
01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.900
stefan jansen: niche will create a specific bio.

502
01:24:59.190 --> 01:25:04.590
stefan jansen: Bio film and a specific group of organisms colonizing.

503
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:21.270
stefan jansen: So with that well that's very briefly going into micro micro biology, which is eventually leading to to other organisms as well, but just to touch upon it with that I want to pass the presentation back to Nick and go to next slide please.

504
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:23.820
bruinsma: yeah thanks Stefan.

505
01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:26.640
bruinsma: has introduced by seven.

506
01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:34.200
bruinsma: there's a couple of well downsides to adding pathetic protection to your multiple.

507
01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:44.520
bruinsma: Besides, protecting it against corrosion, of course, but especially with I CPS what we've seen is that the pH drops, and that this can and that dangerous.

508
01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:54.780
bruinsma: gases can occur, and these need to be ventilated or the water needs to be replaced replenish so what we've seen so far in the auto industry is that.

509
01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:14.370
bruinsma: In the design, what a replenishment holes are added in the wall in in the part of the Monaco below the mean sea level and that Eric lensman holes are applied somewhere above the water level but below the act like platform.

510
01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:35.790
bruinsma: And these designs can of course be optimized because the unsteady marine environment, such as the ways to dive in the current they drive, basically, together with the orientation of those holes in the size of those holes how much water and air is flowing in and out of your mind about.

511
01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:43.500
bruinsma: What was possible and by by Andrew as well, so we have very limited information.

512
01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.180
bruinsma: About marine growth.

513
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:53.190
bruinsma: And then the dmv guideline that he showed was even only talking about marine growth on a vertical surface.

514
01:26:54.270 --> 01:27:05.760
bruinsma: If you can imagine that the steel monopole like this, but maybe it's damn it me the diameters the steel is about it's almost 10 centimeters thick so inside of your.

515
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:13.980
bruinsma: Overall whole which you make there is basically also horizontal surface of about about 10 centimeters.

516
01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:22.110
bruinsma: Which is also then expose to quite significant flow philosophies about what type of species.

517
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:30.030
bruinsma: In such an environment will thrive or and whether it will be a hard substrate or something soft and how Bermuda will.

518
01:27:30.450 --> 01:27:47.640
bruinsma: It will be there's quite quite limited actually know and we do try to make an assessment estimation, on what it does, eventually, for your water replenishment because we want to know how much new seawater flushes in with with each waves.

519
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:59.760
bruinsma: So Stefan also said a lot of lot of new ideas for additional research or survey offshore to to get more insights into this.

520
01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:06.000
bruinsma: And then we can see whether or not we can optimize this read this replenishment and.

521
01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:11.520
bruinsma: grows your production system and maybe even add.

522
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:19.500
bruinsma: The nature inclusive design so let's see if we can optimize this for certain pieces of content.

523
01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:21.900
bruinsma: Here we go to the next slide please.

524
01:28:25.170 --> 01:28:27.660
bruinsma: So what we've done within the dark is done a couple of.

525
01:28:28.890 --> 01:28:35.640
bruinsma: Physical models so you can see where a blue dye was placed inside of a a monopole.

526
01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:42.750
bruinsma: And that, in this case, there is only a tight going up and up and down and there is a current.

527
01:28:43.320 --> 01:29:00.420
bruinsma: And because the internal free surface is allowed to well the holes are that big that that internally the water is moving at the same at the same pace and outward that is basically as sort of bumping cylinder it's pumping in and out the content of the cinema.

528
01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:08.580
bruinsma: In terms of volume and what you would see if you add waves that the amount of water being replenished eaten a lot faster.

529
01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:21.150
bruinsma: And what we've done is we've made a rather simple Hieronymus model which which we can evaluate the amount of water that is the line of.

530
01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:35.820
bruinsma: Duty side and waves and which we take into account the vertical and location of the holes and also the orientation with with respect to the current and with respect to the waves.

531
01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.100
bruinsma: What we then can do with this information that's on the next slide I believe.

532
01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:44.430
bruinsma: I know this was a.

533
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:54.930
bruinsma: Besides this simplistic I remember model, we can also do detailed cfd models, because what we see in some cases, is that if.

534
01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:09.690
bruinsma: you're in a certain storm condition the waist get really high if you then have quite significant what replenishment holes like you sometimes see with the cable entry holes, which are up to up to a meter in diameter.

535
01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:11.070
bruinsma: That there's such as.

536
01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:12.990
bruinsma: significant flow through.

537
01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:27.120
bruinsma: These water replenishment holes that you get jet flows up to 10 meters per second and i'm really wondering whether or not a God sitting inside of your own one about will like it if there is a jet.

538
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:45.600
bruinsma: But what you can also see from this detailed analysis is that actually outside of the area close to your whole the flow is is not that significant, so there is shelter inside of this is sort of this March offshore structure.

539
01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:48.360
bruinsma: Then next slide.

540
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:59.550
bruinsma: that's regarding the water quality model we seen from various people the the that some of the parameters.

541
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:14.370
bruinsma: Of the sea water offshore are very important to promote certain habitats for for, for instance, God or lobster or some other organisms what we can do with the water quality model.

542
01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:35.190
bruinsma: Is that by taking the water, which is flushing in and idols i'm on a power we feed this into the Dell walk, which is a delta is built water quality model, and with that we can model basically all of the chemical processes, including the ICP inside of your model.

543
01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:46.980
bruinsma: And then look at the effects on, for instance pH the dissolved oxygen and all those other parameters which are important for the for nature.

544
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:58.950
bruinsma: What you see here on the on the lower left his first the hs signal so that's the significant wave height of time for see and as well.

545
01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:16.500
bruinsma: And that's for for four months, and what you see in the top part, the more or less blue figure, you can see a couple of red lines and red lines indicate the location of a ICP anode and then there is two white lines.

546
01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:22.950
bruinsma: And I hope those are visible and add those two white lines, there is a replenishment hole.

547
01:32:24.150 --> 01:32:31.170
bruinsma: And we can see there's a bottom that's the sea, the sea floor and then there's mean sea level and what we can see over time.

548
01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:38.100
bruinsma: Is the change in pH level in the bulk of the water over the vertical depth.

549
01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:53.790
bruinsma: So we can see, for instance, that after the first of May there's a quiet period where there are hardly any waves and we can see that, especially near the button below the lowest water replenishment all the pH drops quite significantly.

550
01:32:55.050 --> 01:32:55.530
bruinsma: and

551
01:32:56.850 --> 01:33:02.580
bruinsma: What we can combine this knowledge with is, for instance, what nature.

552
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:18.300
bruinsma: Species like to settle at what period in time and then we can see whether or not a certain water blandishment then cathartic detection system designed for offshore wind is then a biblical applicable for such as BC.

553
01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:30.480
bruinsma: Then I have one final slides yeah the next one, and then we can go over to discussions, so I said.

554
01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.200
bruinsma: yeah this one indeed.

555
01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:41.520
bruinsma: Regarding dissolved oxygen, but I think I think this was already mentioned by a couple of couple of colleagues.

556
01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:52.740
bruinsma: Is that the oxygen over time will be variable and it's affected by marine growth and the clogging up of those holes, so if the holes are clogged up.

557
01:33:53.520 --> 01:34:12.990
bruinsma: Significantly, then there's less new seawater coming in, and besides that there's also in demand course of oxygen if you get more species and more biomass inside of your inside of your mana about those will also have a larger uptake of oxygen and there might be some kind of a balance.

558
01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:18.240
bruinsma: And I think that's it, I have a couple of.

559
01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.100
bruinsma: things for the discussion on the next slide but thank you for your attention.

560
01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:31.860
Daniel Kuchma: Thank you very much, Nick Thank you very much, still fun um if we have one short question we'll take it, but then otherwise we're going to turn it over to Jeff.

561
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:56.670
Daniel Kuchma: So Jeff I think that means what we'll do is we'll Jeff will finish it off, etc, and then, as part of that we'll have a little bit of time, hopefully, for some broader discussion and for that questions to any of the people that presented either in part one, part two, so over to you Jeff.

562
01:34:57.540 --> 01:35:06.690
Geoffrey Swain: Okay, thanks done and actually first thank you, Dan for bringing us all together because it's just been a fascinating hour and so many minutes.

563
01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:16.890
Geoffrey Swain: And I think the reassuring thing is all the joint knowledge from everyone who's presented really gives us an avenue to make better decisions as we move forward.

564
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:31.560
Geoffrey Swain: So i'm Jeff swaying professor of ocean engineering florida's to technology Monica may her you just recently heard from and Calgary the one just very important than the research we've done.

565
01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:47.820
Geoffrey Swain: And the knowledge we gained so our interest really is now, you know how do we manage the interactions between Great marine growth and internal water chemistry and its really following on from Nixon stefan's presentations.

566
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:57.990
Geoffrey Swain: That, how are we going to do this, and the way I look at it, as to say, well, how do we perceive ringrose and the associated for that.

567
01:35:59.010 --> 01:36:07.230
Geoffrey Swain: And typically as an engineer you look pantages by our founding and it's something you want to control is something you want to maybe prevent.

568
01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:18.720
Geoffrey Swain: And the picture on the riders some blue muscle founding of actually a sea water intake taking the naturally the late 70s, or sea water intake to one of the North Sea oil platform.

569
01:36:20.010 --> 01:36:23.160
Geoffrey Swain: I think nowadays we try and look upon it more as ecology.

570
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:32.760
Geoffrey Swain: And really as engineers, how can we designed to enhance and nurture nature and again that little picture on the writers of love helio producer.

571
01:36:33.570 --> 01:36:43.410
Geoffrey Swain: Deep sea coral and the irony is that again in the 60s and 70s trawlers basically decimated these deep sea color coral reefs.

572
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:58.200
Geoffrey Swain: And the arrival of the North Sea oil structures gave them a habitat and I understand these corals and now flourishing on the on the oil and gas structures in the North Sea and then finally married culture.

573
01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:03.060
Geoffrey Swain: Can we use these structures in any way to benefit to.

574
01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:08.730
Geoffrey Swain: See creature production, the next slide.

575
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:27.540
Geoffrey Swain: Well, I think we've heard so much about this and the previous talkers have really given us a great insight into the factors that influence the biology of the internal space, so we look at it in terms of the structure the mana.

576
01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:38.640
Geoffrey Swain: pile the chemistry inside and then, if you have openings what's the balance you're going to do, and then, finally, how does this all interact with corrosion.

577
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:47.460
Geoffrey Swain: And in the brief time I have available to me, if you look at the model pile what i'm going to be focusing on is dimensions.

578
01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:49.650
Geoffrey Swain: What is the.

579
01:37:50.880 --> 01:38:01.830
Geoffrey Swain: influence of different diameters on the volume to surface area when we look at chemistry i'm just going to focus on oxygen oxygen is a prerequisite for life.

580
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:11.910
Geoffrey Swain: And so, if we want to look at it as a means to control by failing we reduce the oxygen if we want to look at it in terms of ecological enhancement.

581
01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:25.920
Geoffrey Swain: or Mary culture, we obviously want to have a oxygen concentrations that support life, the biology, well, we need to understand that as Andrew so well toward us and basically anticipating what will grow there.

582
01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:40.110
Geoffrey Swain: And the final diagram on the right is kind of interest to me it was actually comes from a researcher in the 70s, so caster in 1974 and he basically.

583
01:38:42.090 --> 01:39:01.770
Geoffrey Swain: defined the marine environment in terms of the redux potential which you see on the y axis in terms of potential and pH it was sort of a poor Bay diagram for the marine environment and the little encircled area there is what we really like to work with us oceanic water.

584
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:14.550
Geoffrey Swain: What we found in the enclosed mana piles which have had cathartic protection you getting more into the lower pH so be more to the left, maybe acidic corrosion pits.

585
01:39:15.210 --> 01:39:37.620
Geoffrey Swain: And then, if you get into the microbial in juice corrosion, then you get in the anoxic marine environments, so these sort of environments are fairly well defined them fairly well categorize but, as I said, for the short time I have i'm just going to really focus on on oxygen so next fight.

586
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:51.480
Geoffrey Swain: One of the things that fascinates me is, if you look at the monitor pile internal space and you look at it, with respect, again, the y axis is volume and cubic meters surface area in square meters.

587
01:39:52.050 --> 01:40:05.310
Geoffrey Swain: And you look at how these relate one to another with multiple diameter, you can see that the volume increases exponentially, as you increase diameter, but the relationship to surface area is linear.

588
01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:14.610
Geoffrey Swain: When he might ask well why is his important or when you think of it, the surface area determines that's where the reactions occur.

589
01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:34.020
Geoffrey Swain: It may be the reduction of oxygen with the corrosion reaction, it may be the reactions developing cathartic chalks which occur when you apply cathartic protection, but now, when we introduce biology we're talking about metabolism and we're talking about respiration.

590
01:40:35.250 --> 01:40:38.250
Geoffrey Swain: And these reactors are supplied by the volume.

591
01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:46.710
Geoffrey Swain: So my sort of hypothesis is the larger diameter monopoles will have a larger volume to surface area ratio.

592
01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:57.000
Geoffrey Swain: And therefore, when we look at it in terms of oxygen depletion it will be slower for the larger diamond of piles and I think the important thing to realize is.

593
01:40:57.810 --> 01:41:12.720
Geoffrey Swain: We cannot treat I believe all mana piles the same there's going to be a dynamics there that's going to be determined by the interactions of the volume and the surface area next slide.

594
01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:24.870
Geoffrey Swain: And so, when we look at dissolved oxygen there's been a lot of research and trying to understand, if you like, the anaerobic and depleted ocean space.

595
01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:42.690
Geoffrey Swain: And on the left, you have a figure that basically shows the interactions with oxygen saturation say seven to eight milligrams per liter for normal and good biological activity, right down to zero when we're getting into the anaerobic environment.

596
01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:53.190
Geoffrey Swain: And I should acknowledge the virginia's judah marine sciences for this for this figure so basically we now have a captured body of water.

597
01:41:54.330 --> 01:42:05.250
Geoffrey Swain: And what we want to do is to ensure that it is both a healthy environment if we're going to put in openings and environment for the biology.

598
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:21.930
Geoffrey Swain: And also that it doesn't go into the very low oxygen regime say about Point two milligrams per liter where you start to get hydrogen sulfide anaerobic activity sulfate producing bacteria, etc.

599
01:42:23.250 --> 01:42:41.670
Geoffrey Swain: And one of the nice things about monica's research and you've already seen this figure a couple of times is now we're looking at the dissolved oxygen and milligrams per liter on the y axis and the duration of her experiment on the X axis and, if you look at the perforated.

600
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:52.200
Geoffrey Swain: pipes you'll see that as the buyer fanning started or the biology started to develop on the inside of the.

601
01:42:53.130 --> 01:43:04.950
Geoffrey Swain: pipe sections we actually saw a depletion of the oxygen and with mcgroarty said we assume that was due to the sort of respiration activity of the organisms.

602
01:43:05.850 --> 01:43:23.940
Geoffrey Swain: And so, when we design our perforations we can either design them that maintain a dissolved oxygen level that is healthy for marine life or actually been designed them to limit the ingress of oxygen maybe to control biofilm.

603
01:43:25.050 --> 01:43:26.790
Geoffrey Swain: And that is, are you designing.

604
01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:36.060
Geoffrey Swain: marine biology as firefighting or are you designing these structures to enhance ecology next slide.

605
01:43:38.130 --> 01:43:41.880
Geoffrey Swain: Well, how does this relate to real life, and this is a bit of a.

606
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:45.750
Geoffrey Swain: I don't take this graph.

607
01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:52.440
Geoffrey Swain: To literally what i've said is okay Mike Los Angeles, the blue muscle.

608
01:43:53.610 --> 01:44:01.440
Geoffrey Swain: What is the time to reduce oxygen to two milligrams believe judah respiration and on the X axis, we have pile diameter.

609
01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:15.930
Geoffrey Swain: i've assumed and oxygen concentration in the ambience seawater seven milligrams per liter i've assumed a muscle respiration about Point six milligrams per hour and a muscle density of 400 individuals per square meter.

610
01:44:17.010 --> 01:44:26.880
Geoffrey Swain: i've assumed there's a linear relationship which never happens in the real world with real biology, but the point i'm trying to make is that pile diameter does matter.

611
01:44:27.570 --> 01:44:39.750
Geoffrey Swain: And it does matter because of the volume to surface area ratio and how the reactants and the products of the reactions basically a buffered by the volume of seawater in which they are.

612
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:41.850
Geoffrey Swain: Operating.

613
01:44:43.170 --> 01:44:43.800
Geoffrey Swain: Next slide.

614
01:44:45.930 --> 01:44:47.370
Geoffrey Swain: So where do we go.

615
01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:59.040
Geoffrey Swain: I mean, as i've already said, Dan Thank you so much, I mean all these talks have been very enlightening and I think it really gives us hope that our combined knowledge can really start to.

616
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:04.110
Geoffrey Swain: come up with some good models to manage the internal space.

617
01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:09.090
Geoffrey Swain: But to have models, you need numbers and so.

618
01:45:10.890 --> 01:45:18.330
Geoffrey Swain: ourselves Dan john pudong from toughs and colleen Lena and Loreto from the woods hole Institute.

619
01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:31.020
Geoffrey Swain: we're going to take monikers initial experimental design we're going to deploy some of these pipes up in the woods hole institute we're going to have another series done here with ourselves in Florida.

620
01:45:32.010 --> 01:45:39.870
Geoffrey Swain: And we're going to try and get more data, basically, the measures the impact of perforations on cathartic protection corrosion and by failing.

621
01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:55.470
Geoffrey Swain: impacts of coatings on cathartic protection corrosion and by failing and then measure the impact of the biology on the conditions in the pipe and on the cathartic protection systems so that is all I have.

622
01:45:56.970 --> 01:46:07.050
Geoffrey Swain: Try and merged the management with our knowledge and how we design these structures basically to perform well from a.

623
01:46:07.050 --> 01:46:08.430
Geoffrey Swain: corrosion perspective.

624
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:11.580
Geoffrey Swain: And also, maybe to act as a.

625
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:19.860
Geoffrey Swain: New means to enhance offshore ecology, so thank you, Dan everyone.

626
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:31.410
Daniel Kuchma: Thank you Jeff and john if you'll just go one more slide forward that would be great and so we do have a little bit of time.

627
01:46:31.470 --> 01:46:34.440
Daniel Kuchma: You know 12 minutes for a little bit of discussion so.

628
01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:45.510
Daniel Kuchma: i've put the agenda backup on here so that you can see the you know the titles for the for presentations on Part one and also what we discussed in Part two

629
01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:53.460
Daniel Kuchma: What the research team is very keen is to sort of get your thoughts get your ideas about what we should be doing next.

630
01:46:54.090 --> 01:47:05.220
Daniel Kuchma: Obviously it's exciting to hear about what industry is doing, you know with or says example that is tremendous you know with Andrew with the studies that he's engaged in but obviously everybody who spoke today.

631
01:47:05.850 --> 01:47:13.740
Daniel Kuchma: Is their area of science, or their leadership is critically important in order to ensure sort of responsible.

632
01:47:14.250 --> 01:47:23.370
Daniel Kuchma: Development in nature, inclusive design and I think there is a sense as described that certainly we can do this, but we and and be effective, but.

633
01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:36.960
Daniel Kuchma: The science is complex there's an incredible number of interactions and we need to do, additional work in order to understand it sufficiently so that we can do nature inclusive design with predictable.

634
01:47:37.530 --> 01:47:47.580
Daniel Kuchma: results and so right in the chat what i'm going to do is i'm going i'm about to paste the survey that you would have seen before, as distributed by email.

635
01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:59.310
Daniel Kuchma: To get your thoughts on a few items, but we do have 10 or so minutes for some direct discussion now and those can be questions to any of the people that spoke.

636
01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:04.890
Daniel Kuchma: or ideas you have or thoughts that you know, have been generated that you would like to share.

637
01:48:05.610 --> 01:48:25.770
Daniel Kuchma: With those who are on the line together so i'll stop talking there and we'll see how it goes and john my suggestion is maybe that we stop sharing and so that those people who want to engage in this conversation and ask questions, we can see all the people in that way.

638
01:48:36.330 --> 01:48:38.190
Daniel Kuchma: So Peter, you have a question go ahead.

639
01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:41.970
Peter Schaumann: I do have a very general one.

640
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:53.190
Peter Schaumann: And the question is in what extent are these results side specific so do we have.

641
01:48:54.150 --> 01:49:12.630
Peter Schaumann: To carry outside specific investigations in each situation so i'm talking, of course, about Baltic Sea and North Sea and others are talking about completely different areas of the world, this is my general question.

642
01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.560
Peter Schaumann: I don't know who wants to answer that this.

643
01:49:22.410 --> 01:49:24.930
Geoffrey Swain: Then this is Jeff I could give it a go.

644
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:26.610
Geoffrey Swain: So I think it's a very good question.

645
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:44.130
Geoffrey Swain: And I think Andrew alluded to that when he showed the ecosystems of the world and you're quite right, both in terms of seawater chemistry and in terms of biology, there are a great deal of differences.

646
01:49:45.210 --> 01:49:54.720
Geoffrey Swain: If you look at it just in terms of the DNA recommended practice because 30 protection, for example, they their practice will recommend.

647
01:49:55.830 --> 01:50:09.360
Geoffrey Swain: Different designs for different see areas just based on the oxygen concentrations see water conductivity etc, and I think when we get into the biology, we have a an equal.

648
01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:18.630
Geoffrey Swain: differential to make so that would be the my input I think it's a very good question.

649
01:50:23.130 --> 01:50:25.530
Andrew Want: I understand yeah I would say that yeah I mean we have.

650
01:50:26.610 --> 01:50:30.030
Andrew Want: There are a lot of knowledge gaps that do exist in certain areas.

651
01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.670
Andrew Want: We do obviously understand.

652
01:50:33.690 --> 01:50:45.690
Andrew Want: The biology and chemistry better some areas have much better studied are there is much less so, I think, another issue to courses is having databases, where which make it to.

653
01:50:47.010 --> 01:50:52.650
Andrew Want: facilitate this knowledge to be shared, this is something I think is generally used industry can be improved.

654
01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:59.160
Daniel Kuchma: And john you had a comment are.

655
01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:10.710
John D. DeFrancisci: yeah, I guess, my apologies, that since I had the slides up I haven't been able to monitor the chat, but one thing that I wanted to ask the Group, but we have a large group people here is um.

656
01:51:11.610 --> 01:51:19.230
John D. DeFrancisci: I know i've been following for a while and I know different countries in Europe have different requirements regards to like the corrosion protection system.

657
01:51:19.650 --> 01:51:24.780
John D. DeFrancisci: Particularly around anode selection and like I believe it's partly tied to the environmental aspects of it.

658
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:36.900
John D. DeFrancisci: wondering if, particularly for like internal water columns if there's any potential concerns with like higher levels of sank or higher levels of aluminum if you use some kind of galvanic system internally.

659
01:51:37.710 --> 01:51:47.340
John D. DeFrancisci: I know i've got one reference that talks about potentially having to investigate how it interacts with the food web but i'm wondering if anyone has any experience or knowledge in that space.

660
01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:01.200
Jamie Lescinski: Stefan Nick you guys I would look to you actually to say.

661
01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:06.000
stefan jansen: something about this yeah I was just pressing on mute.

662
01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:19.350
stefan jansen: But I know there have been some studies into this a couple of papers have occurred and I don't know them by heart, but what the outcome was for aluminum.

663
01:52:20.490 --> 01:52:21.450
stefan jansen: The effect is.

664
01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:32.010
stefan jansen: Not as critical as for zinc because a large part of it actually precipitates and becomes non bioavailable.

665
01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:46.110
stefan jansen: However, I would recommend to to to make a now view of these papers that occurred, and I also know of project that the delta iris was was involved in were in general.

666
01:52:47.040 --> 01:53:00.540
stefan jansen: fri metal emissions from offshore wind activities we're explorers and well what I heard from colleagues was that that the the impact for a relatively.

667
01:53:01.410 --> 01:53:16.830
stefan jansen: Low still so so that that's that's optimistic, at least, but of course it we discussed this with with colleagues also last week, and what is very important also in public acceptance is that.

668
01:53:17.850 --> 01:53:34.230
stefan jansen: That clear data is shown on the effects sort of either when with regards to to to metal so of course the ideas about it's toxic toxic and effects and it's very important than to come up with.

669
01:53:35.370 --> 01:53:37.470
stefan jansen: detailed knowledge about this.

670
01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:40.440
stefan jansen: And and one other thing is.

671
01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:48.570
stefan jansen: Because I saw in in in the in the mentee questionnaire, one of the questions race was already.

672
01:53:49.680 --> 01:54:02.610
stefan jansen: If if there are negative effects should should this should offshore wind, be limited or wrong, and I think an important thing is that that there's a lot of.

673
01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:11.820
stefan jansen: Things that can be done with mitigation and also the choice for difference if you, for instance, look for corrosion.

674
01:54:13.410 --> 01:54:18.300
stefan jansen: Protection options that you have you have different choices and and.

675
01:54:19.410 --> 01:54:39.750
stefan jansen: So even if you come to the conclusion that certain options have bad consequences for the environment, in many cases, there are also options to choose for different types of protection systems or to choose a way to to to mitigate effects, and I think that that's very important.

676
01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:47.550
stefan jansen: sorry about the long answer, but lotsa interesting things to.

677
01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:48.510
John D. DeFrancisci: Thank you.

678
01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:56.280
Daniel Kuchma: Jeff will give you a sort of maybe a last word there and then i'll just make a closing comment and will complete the workshop.

679
01:54:57.300 --> 01:55:03.270
Geoffrey Swain: I was curious how widely have the water replenishment holes been embraced in Europe.

680
01:55:04.410 --> 01:55:15.210
Geoffrey Swain: and have people gone back and retro fitted a few like holes into existing structures, so I don't know if this is a question for NICO and Stefan or or anyone else.

681
01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:16.680
Geoffrey Swain: Thank you.

682
01:55:18.330 --> 01:55:20.040
bruinsma: I think I can I can take that one.

683
01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:29.850
bruinsma: I think, in general, the one replenishment halls has been quite widely accepted, what we see in current of show in menopause.

684
01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:40.350
bruinsma: retro retrofitting of holes in monopoles i've not seen, because I can imagine that it's a quite an impossible task I would say.

685
01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:45.090
bruinsma: What we do have heard of in some cases, is that.

686
01:55:47.250 --> 01:56:01.470
bruinsma: By using both the water planet and holes and the really new and innovative coatings is that people wait with applying ICP.

687
01:56:03.210 --> 01:56:09.120
bruinsma: So they make a design for certain multiple with replenishment holes.

688
01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:15.030
bruinsma: And that the ICP system is actually only later deployed.

689
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:35.790
bruinsma: In some cases, you might have a combination of cathartic protection with six sizer I notes, which are there first and then later applying ICP because you've been imagined it I see only works by the time you have power and the Foundation goes in at the start of your project.

690
01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:44.940
bruinsma: So you have to bridge the gap, either by applying a really good good coating or having sacrificial no it's in place.

691
01:56:47.490 --> 01:56:50.040
bruinsma: that's it that's at least my current.

692
01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:53.880
bruinsma: State of what what design looks like.

693
01:56:56.580 --> 01:57:04.560
Daniel Kuchma: Nick Thank you very much, and since we're one minute away what i'll do is i'll have a little bit of closure, first of all thank you to the speakers.

694
01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:09.000
Daniel Kuchma: That you that was really you know my opinion really amazing and inspiring.

695
01:57:10.170 --> 01:57:19.110
Daniel Kuchma: So much promise for the future, and so you know, obviously this workshop was not about result and getting to all the technical details.

696
01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:25.740
Daniel Kuchma: When Jeff and I were talking about this a day or so ago, who were saying you know, looking at everybody present what we need is a two day workshop.

697
01:57:26.190 --> 01:57:39.870
Daniel Kuchma: So we do look forward to your ideas, so what would make sense for the next steps in this and we'll be working on ideas and trying to get it proposals out there to to get the Community together on a number of these items.

698
01:57:40.890 --> 01:57:52.710
Daniel Kuchma: So there is a survey, please completed if you can the there will be another workshop and about a month that's going to be looking at structural aspects associated with the use of perforations.

699
01:57:53.130 --> 01:58:02.490
Daniel Kuchma: And what might be an optimal level, as some of you may know, there's investigations under if you look at large diameter mana piles in deep water.

700
01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:11.790
Daniel Kuchma: Their design is controlled by wave loading and so people are looking at the impact of perforations on reducing the peaks of the wave loads.

701
01:58:12.090 --> 01:58:20.580
Daniel Kuchma: By distributing it out over a course of time, as the tires mentioned, you know if you have small holes, you can get wider jets at 10 meters per second.

702
01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:29.130
Daniel Kuchma: If you completely open it up a large amount the wave just goes through, and so we've been in conversation with some fabricators about what might be an optimal level.

703
01:58:29.490 --> 01:58:35.910
Daniel Kuchma: So we'll be getting into some of the structural design issues stress concentrations buckling when you have perforations etc.

704
01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:46.890
Daniel Kuchma: In the next workshop we'll probably have a one after that, which is starting to look at what types of field and laboratory studies are needed to further advance the science so.

705
01:58:47.370 --> 01:58:53.940
Daniel Kuchma: My sincere appreciation gratitude to everybody who put in so much time today and for everybody else who.

706
01:58:54.480 --> 01:59:05.610
