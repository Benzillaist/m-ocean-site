WEBVTT

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Thank you very much for participating in this event on behalf of the advisory panel and the rest of the research.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This This is greatly appreciated by name is Dan Coachman, I'm.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:31.000
At Tufts University tufts university is located in the Boston area. just before we get underway. I'll remind people sort of mute, please, unless you're speaking so I think we have our really exceptional

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
group of speakers today, and that the workshop workshop should be very informative and inspiring as well.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I know I was inspired by looking through people's slides that they're going to present i'll begin with a little bit of a short introduction to the project what we're trying to achieve in the workshop et

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
cetera, and then for part one John if you want to tab

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It's gonna be a number of presentations which We could consider to be more motivations and examples of nature inclusive design.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And this is primarily going to be looking at the results of some field studies, plus some great initiatives.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So part 2. What we're going to do is discuss 4 specific topics that are particularly pertinent to this particular project for bomb.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So let me continue. sort of with a little bit more of an introduction before we get to part one.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So next slide, John. So if you go back 10 years or so, it was.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Assumed that the inside of monopiles, where air tight and water tight, and therefore, once corrosion started in oxygen, was depleted, it would stop. Unfortunately, there.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Was leakages, and to completely close those off was not possible.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So corrosion continued, and so balm has, you know, has funded studies to look at this.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And so the study we're looking at at the moment John if you would bring up the perfect is they've asked for recommendations for what should be used for corrosion protection systems on the inside of monopiles with

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
consideration of air and water chemistry. which, depending on what you choose, can be a little bit problematic.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So our research proposal and project has these 4 elements. One is to look at the impact of the selected corrosion protection system, and by that we mean coding and Catholic protection.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
In the extent, extent of codings, etc.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And as well as perforations. On what type of chemistry you have internally as well as what type of crochet you have As a second element.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We are looking at the impact of adding perforations for air and water exchange on structural design and loadings that will be the subject of the next workshop.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Number 3 is looking at the impact of the selected crochet protection systems and perforations on marine, gross and habitats.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This is what this one is about. Number 4 is we are developing plans for needed field and laboratory studies for advancing science and practice, and this summer we're looking forward and hoping to get underway with a field.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Study. So next slide, John, you were. You were good there.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.000
In thinking about our talk today. it's important to be aware, of course, as soon as we start putting heartscapes into the environment, they these they attract a lot of growth.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Particular, more different types of brain growth depending on area depending on materials.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And This is something that we don't understand in the science as much as we really need to, and one of the functions of the discussions today is to sort of advance everybody's understanding and also identify where we need to understand

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
things a little bit better. And in thinking about this, at least, the research team sort of have 2 thoughts.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:02.000
One thought is, if we do good things to the marine habitats with the structures we design, then perhaps we can develop hundreds of gigabytes of offshore wind.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But if we do things that are not are harmful to the environment and people's livelihoods, we probably won't get the opportunity to fight climate change to via, offer win to the degree that we really wish that We

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
want to. and I guess the second thought is based on the examinations.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
That really seems that we can do this. but there is some advancement in science, and there's going to be some field trials, etc.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
In order to do it in the most responsible and reliable way.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So next slide the research team, the Contractor research team, Jeff Swayne and Kagler from Florida Institute Technology.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Colleen, Hansel, and Lena, from which whole ocean graphic institution, and then myself and Johnny, who dung from tufts next.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We have it a fantastic advisory panel who come from across the world and bringing credible experience in design, and they represent a lot of different stakeholder communities, and we're very appreciate for their efforts as well

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000
as a number of other folks who you're going to hear from today in the presentations and in the moderated discussions next.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So we've had 8 workshops 6 on the previous project.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We did for bomb on corrosion and fatigue.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And then this is our second workshop. On this project A a workshop can sort of have a range of different characters, one end on the extreme left.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:34.000
It can be informative presentations and that's what the workshop today is principally about some of the other workshops that we've had is been more of a technical committee meeting where people are sharing

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the expertise and debating identifying where there's consensus where there's differences of opinion and what degrees of uncertainty are okay.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Next, John. So meeting legislature, logistics, please stay muted unless you are speaking, meetings being recorded.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Next. Okay. So we'd like to make really extensive use of chat today.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So please use chat to introduce yourself to the degree that you wish feel free to include links.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And then, if as we're going through the presentations and discussion, you're thinking of projects, people things in the literature that you think would be helpful to be shared, this would be a great benefit similarly would be your

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:30.000
suggestions for future research that is needed if you have questions for speakers and moderators, or anybody else, put forth those questions as well.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Even if there isn't time for us to answer them and discuss them at this workshop, what we're gonna do is we're going to have minutes from this workshop, and we're gonna take those questions and try and

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
answer them as best as possible, and it is any good PHD.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Student knows when they first start communicating with their advisors.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
It's like the most important thing are the questions that you try and answer.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So we're greatly appreciated your contributions to things in this way.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
We are not. when we put forth the minutes and list the questions and other comments and suggestions other than of course, your self introduction.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:22.000
We are not going to be recording your names in the chat so feel free to suggest what you may initially seem like a crazy idea. and when we get into discussions we'll use the raise hand approach some people like to turn on

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
their video as a way of flagging us if they have a question.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So we don't, miss you and so John next slide so we're gonna get right on to part one.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And so we have 4 great talks lined up and so we'll get right underway.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I believe Rebecca with yours

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Fantastic, Thank you Dan, and good morning, everyone or good afternoon depending on what's part of the world you're in

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It's a pleasure to be joining you my name is Rebecca Green. I'm.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
A senior scientist with the national Renewable Energy laboratory.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Here in the Us. or our N. Rel. my PHD.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Is in biological oceanography i've been at Enron. now for about 3 and a half years, and I work on a variety of offshore wind activity, including in the environmental space fishing access multi-use of

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the ocean, and citing, as well as feasible feasibility studies around offshore wind development.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So it's my pleasure today to be here with my copi Mark February from the pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and I'll give him a chance to introduce himself in just a minute we're here

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
representing our project, or which stands for the Us.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Offshore wind synthesis of environmental effects.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Research project, and it's our pleasure to provide an overview for you today.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
The goals of this project where we're at and where we're going in the future meeting.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
It's being recorded with that mark would you like to introduce yourself as well.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Please. sure. thanks. rebecca everyone i'm mark I work at Pacific Northwest national Laboratory.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
It's been great to collaborate with Rebecca and her team on this project.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I am a mechanical engineer by training, but my work is broadly in the offshore wind space and primarily focus now on offshore wind and and wildlife effects.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Still, I work on this project, and then I broadly work on developing and testing wildlife, monitoring technologies for offshore locations.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So I would pass back to Rebecca who's gonna start us with the with our review excellent thanks.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And I think, Mark, we decided to get the award for being the earliest participant on the call.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So thanks thanks for joining on the Monday morning. next slide, please. Great.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So First we have a brief introduction to our sear project. We're a little over 2 and a half years into the project.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Now. this work is being performed at the direction of the Us.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Department of Energies office of energy, efficiency and renewable energy Wind Energy Technologies office otherwise known as Doe Veto

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Between our 2 national laboratories cannell and nl we're jointly performing this work which is a multi year collaborative effort to facilitate knowledge transfer from around the world related to the environmental effects

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000
of offshore wind, energy development in terms of project objectives.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:11:02.000
These are multi-fold. We have been working over the last couple of years to summarize the international understanding of environmental effects, monitoring tools and mitigation strategies for offshore wind development again from around the world

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
so globally, and how it applies to both the Us.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Atlantic and Pacific Coast and potentially offshore wind energy development.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:23.000
In those areas we are specifically examining which of the state of the art methods and technologies that are currently being used are relevant to environmental issues.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
With application to us offshore wind development.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:41.000
We are identifying the knowledge and research gaps based on the diversity of species, habitat users and stressors that we see here in the Us.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:54.000
With consideration for our Us environmental, legal, and regulatory structure as well as technological innovations down the road, both in terms of the types of fixed bottom and floating platforms.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000
That could be deployed looking ahead as well as the types of monitoring and minimization technologies that could be used.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And perhaps most importantly, we're working collaboratively to develop outcomes with existing science entities and regional organizations.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Who I have are also working hard to minimize the environmental effects of offshore wind development.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Alright, next slide, please. So there are 3 main products from our your activity, and there's the Qr.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Code here. as well. if you'd like to go to the link otherwise.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:52.000
If we haven't already we'll put the the link to the Serr project in the chat our first deliverable or activity, What's to about to develop a series of educational research briefs there's 7 of these briefs

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:06.000
which will overview in just a minute. They review the state of the knowledge on stressor and receptor interactions, monitoring methods and technologies, mitigation measures and cumulative impacts related to 7

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:16.000
topics, whether it's underwater noise the effects potential effects of emf considerations for birds and bats, and the like.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Our second deliverable or product was a series of webinars overviewing each brief with an expert panel.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Folks from both the Us. and Europe we're very thankful to the experts who review these educational research breeds.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Then also served on these panels. These webinars were run from last November.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Through this this february disseminating the findings from the research briefs to the offshore wind industry, and others who are interested.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And we're extremely well attended so certainly a lot of interest in these topics in the community.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And finally, we're working set of research Records recommendations for both the Us.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Atlantic and Pacific Coast to summarize information gaps and barriers.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Current challenger challenges around us offshore wind development to in to inform and guide future efforts.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Next slide, please the the 7 topics that we addressed in a series of educational research briefs here on stakeholder engagement identify these topics.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.000
These are topics where stakeholders felt that there was enough information to put together.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And it. a research brief They could be short and succinct as a science summary on what we currently know, and some of the research questions moving forward.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So these 7 topics most of these have been published our last 2 will be coming out soon.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:15.000
We analyze underwater, noise effects on marine life, or synthesize existing information on underwater noise effects and ring life, bat and bird interactions with offshore wind industry.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:31.000
The next topic here relates to entanglement, so the risk to marine life from ring debris and floating cable systems, whether through primary or secondary entanglement, or even possibly tertiary entanglement one of

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
the briefs. we'll be talking about in detail today, is the one on benthic disturbance from foundations, anchors, and cable.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:46.000
We'll also be talking about the introduction of new structures or artificial ref effects on fish ecology.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000
We also had a brief on vessel collisions and one on electromagnetic field effects from offshore.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Wind next slide, please, and Rebecca just if you can.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
2 min herself. so I know it's going to be brief time goes by very quickly.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Thank you. Yes. Well, I will turn this over then to to Mark in just a second.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
So in terms of the introduction of new offshore wind form structures on fish ecology.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:22.000
These are some main takeaways that we provide within that brief around the placement of new structures and potential artificial refugees.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:32.000
What's been documented at European wind farms for example, in terms of the attraction of fish, and in first wind farms in us waters.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:48.000
What we think, what we know for both fixed bottom and potentially for floating wind farms, a variety of monitoring tools, exactly and methods and types of data collection.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And then, we also synthesize best management practices, such as for citing and choice of structures.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
In this brief, and I will turn it over to Mark. Next, to talk about the other.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Bring, and you can go to the next slide as well.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
This brief talks about the that the disturbances from option or wind structure is actually no one back.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:19.000
It's Okay. for you know the basic disturbances from foundations, anchors, cables associated with offshore wind farms and their effect on the bench environment.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:29.000
This primarily occurs during after construction, and also a little bit in the decommissioning effect of spending how the bending environment kind of moves into that area.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000
So the point. So 3 things like this say briefly, you can check out the brief, and maybe many of you know this.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
The primary effects on the bed. the habitat are generally localized.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
The area closest to after web infrastructures. This is generally red around the the turbines themselves.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:59.000
The primary effects can occur. Lots of can include lots of habitat from the new subc equipment that's installed conversion of that habitat through the introduction of new hard strip substrate and then, lastly,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
seba disturbance and recovery. after the construction activities.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:19.000
So let's move on to the next slide and i'll just talk about our upcoming and ongoing efforts, and really our ongoing efforts are focused around developing research recommendations both on the atlantic.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Coast and the Re. and then on the Pacific coast, and then maintaining a list of those research recommendations.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
These we published on teeth as they're kind of ongoing, now.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:37.000
So we're hosting workshops that are gonna generate that I the those research recommendations, and then we hope to keep them updated.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
In an ongoing manner through the through our website.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000
So. With that, thank you all for your attendance. You can go to the next slide which has our contact information.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
If you would like to follow up, feel free to send an email to either me or Rebecca.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:03.000
And thanks, Dan. Thank you We're, back thank you Mark and as if you think of questions for Rebecca Mark, please do include them in the chat.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
So, Drew, I see your online. so it's over to you Alright, thanks.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I'm gonna move very fast the slides are here for your reference.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
You're gonna see the same pictures over and over again and i'm standard.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
How many slides we have. This is a synthesis of work done in the Us.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000
As well as referencing work in Europe so i'm gonna move pretty quickly here just acknowledging the other folks.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:44.000
If you can go on to the next slide so the this is just a summary of work that has been done at the Block Island Wind Farm, including Redo, and that'll be on the next slide.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So it's really important to understand There are only 5 turbines.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:00.000
These are lattice jacket, so they do not relate to the dominant topic of this workshop, which is large circumference monopiles, and what may or may not go on inside them.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:13.000
So keep that in mind. So lots of different work. i've posted some links to these publications, and i'll put my email up for some reason they don't work next slide.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Please. So this is an overview from Rodeo.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:28.000
That was a bone funded project which actually looked specifically at growth on the structure and the changes to the Benthos.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:36.000
We did work more on fish ecology of surrounding these turbines. and that report is available and linked down below there.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Next. So a quick spin through this. This has been said many times in many different places.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:56.000
But essentially the marine growth and I just want to make the point. We're gonna be talking about marine growth biofowing a lot of different terms from an ecological perspective.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:05.000
I'm not a fan of any negative values associated with growth from an engineering perspective that's a different point.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
So we're gonna focus on growth here structure goes in the water.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000
It goes from the inner title, all the way down to the sea floor, or regardless of whether it's a floating or not, there is some connection.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:28.000
So what happens is we do change the bottom there's a lot of energy flow as a result to the introduction of this, our focus is largely on the flow of energy.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
And through enrichment through the growth on the structure.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:43.000
And so the structure itself has this growth, but the seafloor around it also becomes modified, and all this becomes a shift in the food web.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:52.000
In the location next, and we really focus on how this biof mass may be exported to the larger ecosystem.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Because unless we understand this, we really don't understand the function of all that biodiversity on the structure. so it's really important to follow energy in a food web or in an ecosystem and this is where the

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
nature design comes in that I think some folks are going to talk about next slide.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Another important thing is this concept of connectivity we don't really have corridors in the marine environment.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:33.000
We have larval distribution and movement, and so this can affect both desirable species, focal species, but also the tension non-native of species next slide.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:44.000
So the food way is is the focus here how does how does this change the habitat and that's what we're beginning to look into next slide.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
So we are going to do a project at the Virginia there's only 2 turbines there.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:58.000
We have an opportunity to look at how some aspects of nature enhance design may or may not affect this broader range.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:09.000
So there's 2 turbines, will enhance one not the other, and use a lot of the techniques that you're gonna hear about from other speakers.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:24.000
So and I can stop right there drew if you Don't mind I'm going to thank you for the expediency of a presentation. but you caught a lot of very important key points.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.000
And the slides were very, very, illustrative and so since I know time is going to be an issue today.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.000
What i'm going to recommend if people have present questions for Drew about past work, future work.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Please do send him, please add something to chat and then we'll make sure that we get responses to those questions or share those thoughts as part of the minutes.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:57.000
And so with that. then we'll move on to the next presentation. and so Anthony is going to be Anthony, followed by Marcell.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
So they have a joint presentation. Thanks, thanks. Stand on. Hi! everyone.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Anthony Diversk is here i'm the just introduced myself on the biodiversity lead for North America offshore for Ersted, and and I wanted to start off here.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Just if people have not heard about it, Just let everyone know about the biodiversity ambition that we have at Orstead, which is, that by 2030 there will be net positive biodiversity project in all renewable energy

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:41.000
projects that are commissioned, and as a result of that we're very interested in exploring you know we don't know what the best way is to get those biodiversity uplifts.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:51.000
And so we're very interested in exploring the different kinds of strategies that we may use either at the offshore wind facilities themselves, or within proximity to those facilities.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.000
And so I just wanted to go through a couple examples of some things we've started to do to look at that biodiversity uplift question.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:13.000
So next slide, please. and the most recent thing that I that I hope and think maybe you all have seen in the in the news is the recoral project, which is a what's best phrased as a core

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:27.000
restoration experiment. at this point and it's off the coast, the west coast of Taiwan, south of where the the Chandela won into a offshore wind farms are located, and what this project is doing

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000
is taking surplus indigenous coral spawn that are collected off of the islands that are also west of the Taiwan mainland.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Those spawner that incubated back in a laboratory to the coral marble stage.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000
And then those larvae are transferred and there's a lot more details in terms of that transfer. that that would have time to get into today.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:57.000
But basically they're they're brought but the idea is that they'll be brought out to those turbine foundations and transferred there, and settlement will be facilitated and then ideally.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:05.000
They will start to grow on those foundations. And Ursid is looking at this as a proof of concept kind of trial.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Again as an experiment, and hopefully, if this approach works in terms of a strategy for growing these coral there's a possibility of staling this up to to other locations as appropriate, and there's a lot more information

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000
about this available online on our website. and there's some videos that you could check out this next slide.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Please One of the other efforts that we've made is is around the area of artificial creation, and i'm just you're going to see a lot of this is not North America.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:56.000
But is is over in Europe. and at one project site there were some boulders that needed to be moved as a result of the project activities, and the idea was that instead of moving those boulders, you know and

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:11.000
removing them to onshore locations, that perhaps they could be rearranged and into a configuration that would facilitate, You know, some kind of use by by organisms.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:19.000
So there were 5,000 borders that were relocated near the end holds offshore Wind Farm in Denmark in 2,012, and there were 20.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
3 artificial reefs that were able to be created by those by rearrangement of those boulders.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:34.000
This is one example the ways we're trying to look throughout the project Life Cycle. to think where we might be able to incorporate these kind of benefits to biodiversity.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Next slide, please. also more recently than that in 2,021.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:53.000
We have these biohuts that you can see a picture of that work created and work that we're doing with Wwf 2, and there are 10 of these that are installed in Gran Harbor in the

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Strait, Danish Kentagut. The idea here is that this will provide a shelter for the juvenile fish and ideally restore cop populations, and also in doing that help help to restore the ecosystem

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:16.000
balance, and you can see these these cages have have some oyster shell within them, and they're lowered into the water, and then they will be monitored over time to see to see what what actually happens as a result

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:25.000
of their placement in the environment, and the next slide, please, and lastly, here and then i'll pass it off to Marcel.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:35.000
We have the cod pipe reachings at the Barcela Wind Farm in the Netherlands. know the waters. and again, this is our artificial reef creation.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Project. And there are 4 of these cod pipe.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Hot purpose, build copied pieces of referred to there that are bad 10 years diameter, and have variable heights.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:59.000
And again, the focus here is on providing habitat for Atlantic cod, since there's an interest in Atlantic cod within the region, and there is ongoing monitoring that is occurring of the cotton

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:08.000
lobster behavior and i'm going to pass it on to Marcel. now in the interest of time, to give you some more details on the work that is going on specific to that.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Thanks very much. Thanks, Anthony. for your nice introduction.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Doing a lot of work. Indeed, I would like to go into more detail on the cot work and the lobster work we're doing, and this is a collaboration between us

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Thank you. Wind on, C. which is a finance finance financing program and the rich North Sea who had a grant from the postcard about next slide. please.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Yeah. we we're performing this experiment in the bcel 2, which is one of the offshore wind farms of first step, as you see, it's about it's in the south of Holland on the border

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:10.000
with Belgium and L. 0. 8 is a monopoly where we have where Ursat has positioned 4 reads: next slide, please.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:18.000
So here in the middle of the green part, you see Elo

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000
And around it for certain circles. Would there be some? Is there some pointer?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:41.000
No. Well, if you go yeah that's reef, one if you go to the right that's 3, 2, and then if you go down the southern reefs 4 and 3 3 3.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
4, and they have arched. they are differently arched.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
That means that they have anti scour and the reefs in the North.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:10.000
They don't have and discover around those reefs. the the red circles we have placed 16 frames with antennas, and next slide, please and we have tagged about. Next, slide please.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:19.000
We have talked about last year 45 cots around all these reefs divide it more or less equally in time.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Or in space, and we would like to know what is the distribution of the code in time and space.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
For instance, Are they homebound? Do they stick to the reefs?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000
And are there differences in behavior between the reefs between them themselves, and also with the monopoly?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Because, if you remember the setup, the Ontario also cover the monopoly.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Next slide, please. This is an example of how how we have been tagging.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Sophie is sketching once an animal is caught and it's 32 cm or bigger.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:09.000
We open the the, the, the the belly, and in the belly we place a tag.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
We we saw we saw it back. We saw the the belly

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000
And back with. So it's not open again. and we place an additional tag in the or just near the spine.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:30.000
So we know from the outside. the animal has a as a tag Inside this acoustic text they send.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:42.000
They send out a ping, and this thing is every minute and it's caught by, and once it's caught by at least 3 of the 16 and tennis you know where it is after recovery.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Big animal there is place black. nice for you to know that currently at this very moment people are catching cold again at ers at Bosla.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Next slide means lots of tagging and next slide for the lobster.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:11.000
I'm very interested in that's I'm very interested in the habitat use in relation to the region, and also so what is the habitat?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Choose is also the substrate use, for instance, for walking, or for for migration?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Or is it used for hunting is there? And what is, for instance, the speed in relation to the type of shift shift rates?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
What is, what are the rhythms? What is the daily reason?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Because what is the seasonal rhythm, and also what are the distances covered?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Because one of the the the resources we're doing is serving 2 lords.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:34:00.000
So one of the Lord is to buy diversity, but on the other end we also serve the the fisheries, and there is a development going on that we will want to have no to use in offshore wind firms and one

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
of the forms of uses uses can be fisheries.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And then, we have the safety factor that all these cages have to be placed at at least 2 and 50 meters from the monopiles and from the in field cables.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:29.000
And up to my knowledge what we've seen so far is that lofsters will go to a cage at the maximum of 125 meters.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:46.000
So I would like to know what is the normal behavior of these lofsters, and is there a chance they will be called by Lobsters place by pages placed at more than 200, and 50 meters distance next slide please, So

00:34:46.000 --> 00:35:01.000
we had to buy the losses. We had not the the means yet to catch lobsters, and also the expectation that there would be not be a lot of lobster, since it the the reef is quite new and here, you

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:12.000
see the picture of the lobster the if you see the the black tube type of thing that is the tag.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:30.000
It's like how how do up as size more or less part of a lot of of your finger, and then we have a tag, a a a numbered additional tag, the the yet string which is attacked to the which

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
is yeah, also more to the right. if you go to mortal right that's attacked to the acoustic tag.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
And then we've also placed one in the back so once the loves are.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:51.000
That's on the left side the previous one you touch so once they've shed their skin their harness.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Then this back tag will will remain we've bought lots of one and a half kilohertz so the maximum Oh, they shed their their mold every one and a half to

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:17.000
2 years. so on efforts. we expect half a year of information on each lobster.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Next slide, please, and 2 min. Okay, I'll speed up So this is the typical results.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:35.000
That i'm expecting on the left side you see the behavior pattern of a lobster on on in this case in England, on soft and hardships on the right side.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:45.000
You see a graph that that on the excesses you see an increase in the percentage of hard substrate, and on the on the other I access.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
You see the speed. You see that on soft, substrate they walk faster than hard.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Subset next slide, please. Somebody collaborating with us is the record not say?

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:15.000
And they are really interested in collecting Edna by and then by Edna, you have a water sample which can tell you something on the local by the version. the the spatial resolution is quite good.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:23.000
At the moment you take and you take a sample on on when the water doesn't run again, i've got the English with.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Then you will see that that that the Edna environmental Dna is really representing the reef below.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Next slide, please. My first results next slide so we've taken out we tried to take out the antennas to get the data.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:55.000
30 were recovered completely. One We recovered the data, but we lost it. frame, and 2 frames to antennas are still stuck in below.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:02.000
In the month. Then if you go down to the right side there we see a presence data.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:17.000
So we see the first row the first 45 rows are the code. and then, if you go down you see the first presence of the of the lobsters.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
So the the rows in which the A is more to the to the left.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Those are the lots of data. So a lot of dogs loves us.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Have have molded or are lost due to due to due to currents, and that place is really a current.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:49.000
I rich area So these animals can be washed away. coming One Wednesday i'm going out again and releasing another batch of lobster.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:39:01.000
So this will see if you have any questions later, on or by the chat I'm available, and this is my email address and telephone number where you can reach me.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Thank you. Thank you ever so much. a lot of inspiring work and it's just great to see the level of evaluations occurring, and as we know, in the Us.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
This is all critically important to us. So James Hi! hi, Dan!

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Hey, everybody i'm jamie lashinski i'm the magic director of one alice U.S.A. for renewables offshore for offshore engineering and energy group we are constructing wind

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:41.000
farms all over the world and i've had the pleasure. of also being our project manager, a number of years ago for the threed printed grief Monacle Pilot Project.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:54.000
And And so what i'm gonna show today are a few things that we've been doing, and basically how we deal with this within most hours, which is like the little sort of microcosm version of how you need to deal with

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:09.000
it in the big in the big picture, alright. So next slide. So, value of artificial reefs, basically the way we see it. And the way we work with it on our various projects which our pilot projects are basically can be independent

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:20.000
of development, and we also have projects. for example, as Marcel just showed and as Drew showed that are part of bigger developments, so both are valuable.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
And Dc. with artificial reefs you See that they Yeah, they play an interesting role with habitat creation.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
They're scalable and that you need to basically work with your site.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Specific ecology and met ocean conditions, and that they basically can support fisheries development.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
They can serve as coastal protection and also enhance biodiversity.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:52.000
They can create interconnectivity. So again, as Drew mentioned, really looking at that connectivity element which you can look at wind farms as a way of face, the connecting and habitats, or creating a ha a broader habitat within

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000
a wind farm by through through pathways of connectivity, restoration elements.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000
You can also consider restoration where you know that there's already been historical degradation, or you might even cause degradation.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
So how do you deal with restoration or offsetting?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
And then also creating opportunities for research and community involvement.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:23.000
The world of research are far from perfectly understood so there's a lot for us to learn next slide.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
So assurement farms. We see them actually as presenting unique opportunities.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.000
But in order to be able to seize those opportunities, you have to connect, you basically can't take it from one perspective.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Both through and again marcel touched upon elements we're looking at it from an ecological perspective, or from an engineering perspective, they actually could be contrary conflicting to each other.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Again from a governance perspective. But basically, in order to be able to have successful project moving forward, you need to look at what you want to develop, why you want to develop it, and you need to look at it.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:03.000
From these different perspectives and iterative fashion, where you basically are combining and having common goals.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:11.000
And basically you're avoiding negative subsequent impacts through governance, engineering, and ecology.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
And again everybody brings their own knowledge into it so you can't do it alone.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:22.000
You need to basically have these community efforts where you need to be lean and efficient, especially within developments themselves.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:31.000
When farm developments also, we see how anthony was describing basically trying to utilize the wind farm that's going to be development developed anyway.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:47.000
But then, bringing this extra opportunity in for research and better understanding, ecological research and better understanding, by basically working together with clients, fisheries, governments, cost contractors, knowledge, institutes, and Ngos.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Next slide. So for ourselves what we've learned we've been basically working with artificial reefs for around a decade, as both scales through projects as through our basically the infrastructure rain infrastructure that

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
we're developing or alongside or even independent from our projects.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:17.000
But basically brief development And marine projects it's an integral part. You need to have sustainable design where you're combining all aspects.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.000
So that in order to have a win-win you need to have basically as compensation rehabilitation.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
You need to look at ecosystem values, but also work within the governance system.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:39.000
You actually have to work with permit systems or utilize these projects as as mechanisms, to actually enable permitting processes.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:49.000
And there's also value in These individual standalone re system developments, especially from a research perspective and development of sanctuaries.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
This is also quite important. when looking at decision, making associated with how and where you develop your structures.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Both Anthony and our cell showed 2 different approaches also Drew, where basically you're looking, you can look at developments that are directly attached to or focused on the marine infrastructure itself that's

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:16.000
going in the water, but you can also look at it as being independent from those structures are trying to utilize those structures.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Where you have the brief itself being developed nearby. and this is quite important from the perspective of decommissioning.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
If you know you have to take that structure out of the water in 25 years or 50 years from now, you need to be really aware of.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Do you want to actually develop your restructure on the structure you need to remove later by permit or develop it.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Next to it, or do you have the right to leave it in the water?

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:49.000
If you develop a reef system there. So these are all big picture, long-term ways of thinking, but are really important in order to be able to define the success of the project.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
So you need to think on the total lifetime of the project.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000
For our approach. Basically, we work again within our projects as well as via pilots.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
The network is hugely important. we would never be successful in any of our reef pilots.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Do we need alone, or even just working only with our clients?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
We always have to leverage knowledge and resources from the community to make it successful.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Also really focusing on this positive impact the positive impact again is can't be just from one perspective?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000
It has to be multi multi perspective. next slide, please.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
So here are some of the different concepts that we've tested globally.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000
So far, So we've worked with really taylor made *d printed structures.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:42.000
So these are very large scale. These are 2 meters wide a meter and a half toll. and these are basically Taylor to the system at hand.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:49.000
They're unique. but they are expensive you have to transport them carefully.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:56.000
And they're they're not necessarily transferable directly in design or concept to other locations.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:03.000
There are modular systems. So we're working with reef systems, by Moses endless reef systems and reef blocks.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:13.000
And these are all systems where you basically, through the modular approach, you build it up through the unique system and then develop it in that way.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000
And they have other yeah, they basically have other advantages and disadvantages.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.000
So again, there's not one design one material that is perfect for any re system you need to basically take it into into consideration.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Be aware, and that there are huge developments going on all the time with materials, and so to leverage the state of the art leverage.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:44.000
The knowledge that's out there to basically build the best artificial reef system for your specific system And next slide.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:55.000
So far our program needs to be overall our goals is the development application of large scale artificial reefs as enablers for marine infrastructure or coastal protection works that's the nature of

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000
our business. So that's the connection to our business our strategy is that article artificial reefs directly address

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Our focus areas of biodiversity and climate change mitigation, and that we're looking to provide state of the artificial purpose solutions.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.000
But with a clear business case we are. We are a business marine infrastructure, contracting, busy.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.000
So we need to basically make a connection to our business for all of the activities that we're involved in.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
And then our approach again. i've already said it so strong strategic partnerships.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Build upon symbiotic dynamics to make sure you have win wins for all parties, and you're not negatively impacting another aspect because of really focusing on one particular vote.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:46.000
One area, and that basically really leverage the different types of systems that are out there to serve our clients and our markets.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:57.000
And then last slide. This is just an example of some of the parties that we've worked with really closely to make Tobc develop some of the artificial reef pilots and projects that we've worked on to

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
date this isn't even comprehensive. but it really it takes a village to do it successfully.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Thanks, Jamie, Thank you ever so much and thank you to all the speakers in this first part, I found you know I think it's inspiring.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:21.000
It's impressive. So much leadership being shown thank you Rebecca and Mark for summarizing the census work, which is also critical, since the Us.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Is a little bit earlier in this, which is fantastic, thanks to the doe in national labs.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Obviously for that tobalm in the rodeo project that drew summarize some of the great work happening.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
All you know, on the first Wind farm in the us block Island, and now continuing in Virginia as well.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:46.000
That's exciting Anthony and marcel for a lot of boots on the ground actually getting in and tagging fish and following the lobsters and everything else.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:49:02.000
And so that's obviously very important for critical industries and Jamie, Thank you for expressing what is needed from a collaboration approach in order to actually being able to deliver something that is a success for all the most

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:14.000
pertinent groups So part 2 of the meeting today, we're going to look at some topics that are much more specific to what is we have to deliver on for this bone project.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:25.000
And so we're gonna get we have 15 min for each of these 4 groups of speakers And so, Monica, let's go start off right off with you.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Thanks, dan So i'm working as a contractor with department of Energy's wind office.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:39.000
But today i'm gonna talk about a field study I did a few years ago, while it florida tech

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:50.000
This project. is written up in materials, performance, magazine, corrosion, control and ecosystems enhancement with offshore monopiles and we also receive the honor of a materials performance innovation

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:08.000
of the year award So i'll dive in next slide. so as we already heard in the project background, there was the original thought of not having active Crosian protection in monopoly interiors.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.000
They found that there was oxygen ingress and then there was a trial in the North Sea.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:28.000
That Alex down which wrote about that they retrofitted aluminum. man nodes in an existing monopile, and that case experienced hydrogen sulfide formation and water acidification and that

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000
chemistry presents a risk for unique corrosion concerns.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Next slide. So for my small field trial, the hypotheses were that a perforated structure could create environment with more favorable corrosion, mitigation, air, quality, and water chemistry compared to a sealed

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
one, and that appropriated structure will create a habitat for marine life.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Next slide So in my experiment I deploy one meter long steel pipes, which represented scaled down monopiles, and I put steel coupons inside for convenient analysis, add 4 treatments, including 2

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:21.000
seal pipes and 2 perforated ones. So within each pair I had a freely crooning pipe and a catholically corrected protected pipe with a zinc sacrificial anode.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:30.000
So the sealed, unprotected treatment represents, originally installed when when farms Field protected is similar to the Norsee case.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Study previously described, and a perforated, catholically protected treatment over on the right is considered in my trout as a potential improved design

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:54.000
So here's how the pipes looked They're deployed from august 30 to October First 2,000, and 18 it port canaveral.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:06.000
They're hung on a floating dock with a bit of a air gap at the top, and some local mud was put at the bottom to kind of represent a driven pile and the wires you see there are for corrosion

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:21.000
measurements, Nick, and so the measurements during deployment we're dissolved. oxygen ph Catholic protection and corrosion rates and at the end of deployment, the weight loss of the steel was

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000
observed, and the habitat development was observed.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Oh, Nick! So, looking at the dissolved oxygen measurements

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:39.000
The black line shows oxygen levels of seawater at the port fluctuate a bit on a daily cycle to do with biological activity.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:51.000
The blue and purple lines show how doesolved oxygen quickly reduced in the seal pipes, which was in line with that theory of oxygen getting consumed during initial corrosion and the red and yellow lines are

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000
the perforated pipes. you can see they match that of the Ambient Sea water.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000
In the first month, and the bit of a decrease in the second month.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Might be explained by the growing biological community. inside the pipes consuming octagon. and next looking at

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Ph: So the black line shows the Ambient seawater stays near neutral peach of 8.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
The blue line shows the sealed, unprotected treatment

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Which the the ph actually increased a bit after the oxygen was reduced, and the purple line shows acidification occurred in the sealed pipe with zinc, so that was similar to the North sea trial with the

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:37.000
aluminum manodes and aluminum in aquery solution can form complex ions that cause acidification.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Reducing ph down to 4 and similarly zinc and an aquary solution may push the electrolyte ph down to 6.8, and that theoretically calculated equilibrium ph was consistent

00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:05.000
with The page value is measured industry this experiment with 6.8, and the red and yellow lines to show that the perforated pipes maintained a ph similar to ambient see water in your neutral so it's

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.000
expected and then next slide shows what we saw.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Inside the pipes at the end of the experiment.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:26.000
So in the seal pipes, there's black and orange corrosion products on the freely crowding treatment, and the methodically protected treatment had heavy chocolate and in the perforated pipes

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:39.000
there's biofailing and corrosion products on the freely corroding treatment, and there was biofounding adhere to a healthy steel on the perforated catholically protected treatment so

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:54.000
next 30 to focus on the habitat. During my weekly business I had some indication that there was a organisms starting to hang out inside the pipes.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:04.000
You can see a crab here curling into one of the preparations, and there is a fish poking out of another one, and then next we'll look at at the end of deployment.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:10.000
What was inside the pipes, so at the time of removing the pipes from the water.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000
In the perforated, unprotected pipe.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:27.000
There were mobile animals, including a snapper and a few crabs, and again the steel was covered in kind of diverse biofounding as well as voluminous rest, and it's one click and looking at the

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:40.000
bottom cap of this pipe, where had the originally place mud, and then, as well as the layer of decaying biofeling on top, and some fresh biofamily top that had kind of recently sloped

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000
off the sides of the pipe. There you can see one of the C.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Scores has some kind of bright orange rust on it.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:56:01.000
So this kind of implied unsustained growth as well as a big risk of steel loss as the biofeling falls off and reveal the new layer of steel so next looks

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:18.000
at the protected pipe. So in there the there were more mobile organisms, that kind of a higher population count and the steel surfaces were covered in diverse file, falling adhere to like a healthy

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:27.000
steel, and in the bottom cap it had the originally place mud, and they're also a few extra kind of animals hiding in there.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:33.000
With one more quick could be at those to the collection.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000
So a lot of life in that one and then next.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Kind of compares the habitats of the the 2 perforated pipes.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
So there was. there was kind of a greater population and more biodiversity.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Of of the mobile organisms in the methodically protected pipe and abundant biofailing on on both of the perforated pipes.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000
And so next is the conclusions of this small study.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Show that a perforated monopile interior walls can more easily and predictably be correct.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Be protected from corrosion with Catholic protection and but catholically protected, perforated monopiles can enhance the ecology of a region by providing a sheltered space within which

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:34.000
the brain organisms tend to be attracted to and and prosper, and that nature, inclusive engineering offers opportunity to complement the local environment and provide ecosystem services.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Monica. Thank you very much for sharing that great pioneering work that I know you injected essentially with no budget.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:49.000
So that's. particular. So i'm just staying on that one John, is great, and we do have like time maybe 6 min for a little bit of Q.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.000
And A. If someone has questions from Monica

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:00.000
And if you do a question, maybe you know, raise your hand, and then I think I will see it.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Turn your video camera on that's often helpful everybody's been including their questions in Chat we will at the end of the session.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.000
I'm thinking probably have close to 15 min for a little bit more of an open discussion based on what everybody's heard to date.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.000
So. if you prefer to save your question until we are farther along.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:41.000
That's good as well, but a way another 30 s or so to see if anybody has a question, and I can keep an eye on the chat again.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Monica. I think everybody knows there's quite a bit to get into.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:57.000
And so what we'll do is we'll move along. then, to Andrew, and if we end up having our collective discussion at the end, that's probably a good way to do things as well.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000
But thank you once again for sharing the great work, Andrew.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Hello, hi! everyone My name's andrew i'm from Harry What University?

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Where I do research in biofounding and dan's asked me today to provide a kind of an overview of file filing in relationship to the sector.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:27.000
So I can have the next slide, please i'm based up in opening which is not capable of the north coast of Stalin.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:37.000
And I work very closely very well, also very close to the European Marine Energy Center, where they are testing and developing waving title devices.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:48.000
And the water is very close to us, are also, of course, commercial scale deployment of offshore, fixed and floating wind turbines.

00:59:48.000 --> 01:00:00.000
So on the next slide. quick introduction to biofueling it's the settlement and growth of organisms as soon as you put something in the water on foul because almost instantaneously as from a

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.000
chemical standpoint, the very second you play something in the water there sought to become chemical reactions.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Very quickly. Bacteria settled to this. a slime forms, and that facilitates the growth of the settlement.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Excuse me, and then the growth of of larger organisms.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
The superficial is divided into microfowing and macro felling.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000
These are Often there are specialists in these different areas microfoundings.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:36.000
A very, very important topic. it's. essentially the overall fowling understanding, however, what i'll be talking about on my own specialization is in macro filing.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000
So we'll be talking more about that topic if I can have the next slide.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
So what is the problem with biofuels?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
What is it doing? Well, as many of you of course, are interested in in in this topic today?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
It's. Of course it accelerates corrosion, and of course, then leads to you know a lack of viability, components, etc.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:08.000
But the other impacts of biofuels include it's increasing roughness on the structure which increases drags You've then made a Christian drag forces which may be relevant for example, on boring systems etc.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Increased weight as well in the morning. censorship, boring systems and and dynamic subsy cables, especially the the strategies for dealing with fouling and removing founding are expensive, and it calls a lot of

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
downtime, so that has economic consequences as well.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:37.000
They can file access areas. so making safe issues with, with, for example, you know, boarding, boarding onto a structure, for example, they can be specific fouling onto annals and on coating.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
So this can then also accelerate erosion with that.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And I do want to talk about that there are some ecological issues which have been touched upon by our earlier speakers. and and so we'll talk about those little bit later on.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Now you may be thinking, but surely we already understand biofounding.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:04.000
We have the oil and gas sector, and sure there are these surrogate industries with. We can learn a lot of information from them, and have learned a lot of information from them.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:12.000
But there are some limitations associated with these. So if I had the next slide, please, is this a new problem?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
The biofuels. Well, there are some unique issues with offshore new languages.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:26.000
So specifically We're using new components and new materials which may not have been previously been tested probably in in the read environment and gone through Its pieces.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Devices are being placed in habitats that maybe have not been studied as well.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Areas of very, very high energy, for example, we're using and also past the world, where we may not have done previous studies.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:48.000
We're also using very narrow in some cases very narrow dime to structures on, especially thinking about floating wind.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Here with with dynamic subc cables and morning systems. I also use a lot of increased use of sensors now for detecting resource, assessment, and performance.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
So there are some unique problems with biofueling.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:08.000
If I can have the next slide, so what are the what are the main factors which, affect founding from one place to well, let me just quickly go through these.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I don't have time to go in much detail. but depth is a big issue, and that's often largely related to the amount of photography coming down to plants.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:29.000
All we can live at the top, but not deep water, yeah she's. The other issues with oxygen acceleration, etc. temperatures a big factor in type of fouling community the type of substrate as

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:44.000
well. A hydrological processes, as well as hydro dynamic processes, will affect the time profiling That you get other other other other parts of water Chemistry important distance from land is important and also distance from

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:52.000
ports are important that's especially when it comes to vessel, transfer of organisms from biological standpoint.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:03.000
There are factors, such as competition, successional processes, and seasonality, which calls differences and changes within the type of following organisms that you get. So as an overall.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:15.000
If you somebody's all up together where you also get a call, is that there are huge geographic differences, so like how the next slide the Earth humans love to create and pitching whole stuff.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So the earth is being divided into these various different Ec.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Regions from a from a marine standpoint, and they see these filling near shore areas and on the on the next slide.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000
These have been come subsequently shorted into into other ones, and some of these areas have been very well studied.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
So, for example, number 25. The North Sea is very well studied, maybe 43.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
The Gulf of Mexico is a very well-studied area as well.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The eastern seaboard of the Us. maybe a little bit less so.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And certainly some parts of the world are probably very relatively poorly studied.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.000
So I can have the next slide, please. so some of the Major Macro, filing groups that you find in the nursery.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I don't have time to go through these and many of you of course, will be very familiar with these types of organisms, but here's a bit of a you know a gallery of some of the main types of organisms and if I can

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:12.000
have the next slide. we have a listing of organism simply that are found in the Northwest Atlantic.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
So on the east and seaboard of the us and again.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
They're often quite similar organisms maybe different species but quite similar.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
In fact, like the next slide. This just continues on with this list of them.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
So we have a pretty good idea for certain regions what type of ordinance.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
You're gonna you're gonna get and we have some idea about what kind of impacts these organisms will be as well.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
But I want to talk a little bit more detail about some of these environmental factors that I previously mentioned.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So if the next slide, yeah, so latitudinal gradient is the important one as well.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000
So what this is showing here. This is a quite an early diagram from from study of with all is A.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000
You get obviously latitudinal gradients of where organisms will will survive, and where they'll live.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:02.000
So as you travel from a north south axis you'll start to experience that a shifting shifting baseline of the major B profiling organisms in those regions.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
So it's not it's not rocket science of course, but it's just illustrating that fact.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:21.000
The next one is debt gradient. So this This study here is showing some oil and gas jackets have been studied in the North Sea, and kind of the take home point without Getting to huge detail is just that in different depths you have

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:28.000
different prioritization. that's right word different characters There is a different characterization of species which become more dominant.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
So a different depth. and I guess to take a point of this, you say you can characterize this.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000
You can. You can recognize patterns associated with depth but you can also be aware of the through locations.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000
You'll get differences in in the in the relative the relative ratio of these different organisms.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
So next slide, please. This is another way of showing depth gradient as well.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:00.000
This is from fourteenth, 1,982 and again it's looking up inside and outside of these jackets and and and the the abundance of it.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000
So again associated changes in these in as we go through.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
So I have a next slide. A lot of the work that I do is looking at extreme exposure environments.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So hydrodynamics are also very, very important in types of biology communities.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:31.000
So what this Mds plot is showing here is that in this case there are 3 main clusters of biofound communities that are associated with sheltered harbor Marina type environments versus high wave environments versus

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000
high tidal flow environment. So this again, these are critical.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Environmental factors that determine the type of organisms that you get falling onto a let's drop you.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So if I have the next slide, please just to briefly talk about seasonality.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
So it probably is no surprise that there are certain seasons.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I should say there are some specific old business have some seasons that they are typically will grow at at annual settle.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Sorry we'll we'll grow the their level sporting seasons are different.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:11.000
So this is showing. this has been tried from locations here at Woods Hole and Chesapeake Bay, so you can have some kind of idea of what species you'd expect at a certain time.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:18.000
If I can, have the next slide. So so we'll work down here in in email at this time, I've visualized.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:33.000
It is. This kind of traffic light system is that with this kind of information you might be able to manage timings of of scheduled maintenance to maximize efficiency of of of your filing mitigations for

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:40.000
example again the next slide. So the other process, what I mentioned is succession.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000
So just like another forest, which goes through very stages until it reaches the climax.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:52.000
You get the same situation with putting a brand new hot substrate into the sea. There is a process of successful changes which go on so.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And I should point out to the what season you put it in will affect that succession.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:05.000
So in this particular case, on the diagram on the right we see that very early on succession you have hydroids in deeper water in a shallow water.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:13.000
You have algae, and then, as it progresses over time, there is a replacement of one dominant organism by another, until you reach canvas.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:22.000
The stasis which can there. The very, the stability of it varies, depending on other environmental conditions.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:34.000
If I get the next slide, please. So just to go back into a twin with the looking at the impacts and some of the ecology as well from a practical standpoint we try to understand biofowing Maybe its

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:47.000
impacts the key. take-up I think I have here is that if you look at this Dnv standard which is for wind turbines, it gives quite a crude estimate of this figure of 1,300

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
kilograms per cubic meter of fouling.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:00.000
But from all the research that they've taken for the standard, this table at the bottom, there indicates very, very, very crudely, just simply 2 depths up to 40 meters.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000
And then down below 40 meters, and then a second one of locations which is central North Sea and nor agency.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
So there's no references to substrate so references.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
You can. Species Rainline is so, my my point being that as a right now we there are many, many gaps.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Knowledge. Knowledge gaps in this, and the the standardization in the industry is quite blunt at this.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.000
At this at this point, partly because there is a lot of variation sometimes between locations.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:37.000
So I go to the next slide, please. I want to just end up by talking about the ecological impacts by providing substrate habitat.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
So this has been touched on by some of our other speakers today.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:56.000
So. Firstly, by placing structures in the sea, you can enhance biodiversity, you're creating more complex substrates a greater variety of substrates, and but or I should say in addition to that

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
these may serve, as I think, is drew and mentioned as stepping stones, which can then facilitate the movement of organisms from one place to another place.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Now these can be perceived, possibly as good quotations or bad quotations.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
It might be an organism that you want to settle there like a a rare, hard coral.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:22.000
For example, but it could also be Yeah, it could be something that's not a state, but it could be an invasive non native species which you are promoting.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It spread because you are giving it substrates by which to move upon.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000
In addition to that service, vessels may work as a as a conduit for further spread of these organisms.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
So on the next slide. I think my last slide or last or 2 just so.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I've been looking this this work in in Oklahoma research, we found there are several non-negative species that are found in the harvest and arenas in a waters i'm I guess

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I'm happy to report to say that at the full scale test centers for title and wave environments so very high exposure conditions.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:08.000
There have been no non-native species recorded so maybe that their hydrographic barriers that are created by in in more exposed conditions, which will, where we might be finding offshore wind deployments as

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Well, so that's that's maybe you know something to keep our fingers crossed about.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I think i've just one last slide and that is to say yes, So there are many, many knowledge gaps which exist in biofouling in in the offshore renewable energy sector so in particular.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:33.000
We don't understand the environments that well that they're they're less studied, I should say, and they're parts of the world, certainly, where they're very very very under studied where we don't understand the founding can you win here as well

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:47.000
as some areas there are materials, niche areas that are unique to these industries that are not as well understood as as, for example, or establish oil and gash gas.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And then again, the overall risk assessment of the role of these structures in connectivity, and then allowing ins to to to to facilitate is nns vase of non major species, transmission is of a concern

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
so there are organizations like glow fowling which are trying to understand this.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
And trying to. yeah, just get a better understanding of the risk associated with this in stream.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:18.000
So that's that's if my so whirlwind well, wind exploration of biofounding there's an email dress down there, too.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
So if you have any questions i'll look at them in the chat.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:32.000
But please do contact me as well. Andrew. Thank you ever so much for that incredibly informative, and you got through that material at an amazing pace, but with also with great clarity.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:43.000
So thank you very much for that does anybody have a question that they'd like to ask Andrew right now, if not what we'll do is we'll sort of then save the time at the end.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
So then we can have questions to any of the people that are presented thus far.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:56.000
But if someone does have a question on some recently presented material that'd be, we can take that now

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Andrew. I think everybody's gonna wait until the end please do ask your questions by chat, etc.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.000
And we will do our best in the minutes to provide responses to those questions.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:16.000
So please do that. and so next we're over to a nick ends to fun.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Thank you, Dad. Then, are you allowing one question Yes, Peter? go ahead, and i'm interested in the question on whether you have quantitative data concerning the marine growth thickness over the year andrew I think anybody have information about

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:48.000
that. So So the questions on bring good thickness has head developed over over over time over time. Yeah, Absolutely.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Yeah. So yeah, we I do have. I do have some of those data from from the from the area that I've studied.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:07.000
They do exist for other other other projects as well. that Dnv standard that I showed towards the end of the talk that that was showing estimates of thickness again for those I am for the the point I was making.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:14.000
On that slide was that it does show estimates of thicknesses for depth, and also the 2 regions within kind of the North Sea, and no agency.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
But again, they're very the very very broad so yeah They do.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000
They do exist to some degree. and there are a lot of additional factors in it.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
It does depend on what species they are, so is it an encrusting species?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Or it is. Is it a compliant organism?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
As far as if you're talking about the effects for example on flow.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000
So yeah, it can be quite complex. But yes, th those data do exist, but they are.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:51.000
They are quite, very between locations. Okay, thank you Peter Peter what we'll do is

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I think, through the questions, etc. and Andrew will maybe with yourself and with some others.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:03.000
If people can actually identify references. If someone list wants to look at some of this material in greater detail, we can work on sharing that.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
So thank you very much. And so over to you, Nick.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Yeah, Thanks, then, and also thanks andrew because I think it's it's a very relevant topic.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
It also comes back to in one of my slides.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
The effect of marine growth actually on hydrogenemics.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
But today Stefan and I will talk you through.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Basically built ours approach to corrosion protection and water and error management in the offshore wind monopoly.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I'll do part of the slides then stefan is taking over, and then I will.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I will rip it up. Can you go to the next slide, please?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
So I think this is already briefly touched upon.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
But what we can do in terms of medication of corrosion.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Inside of these software structures is apply coatings and either apply sexual annotes, zinc or aluminum, or an Icp system.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:11.000
And i'll talk about the pros and cons or the the alternatives in the in the next slide.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Can. please go to the next end So before actually going to what's these systems do to the environment is a question I post linking to the first part of this this session is can we make these Designs:

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:51.000
more nature inclusive. So, taking into account the nature and what what nature needs to to thrive, we've already seen quite a couple of very beautiful pictures of either fish or lobster or muscles, or I think even even seals,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:02.000
are popping up close to wind farms. And the question is that we we ask ourselves, is, to improve that your inclusive design, can we?

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Have a limitation of large scale impacts, such as, for instance, noils.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:18.000
But you can also think of the shedding of zinc or aluminum metals into the mid into the environment.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
And what does this do for the for the marine environment?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I think we've also we've also heard talks about restoration of historical species, but also preventing invasive species to come to these places, and by that also increasing bio

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000
biodiversity we're enhancing it and I think for that.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:54.000
It's really important to both measure and model different types of environmental conditions like the temperature.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Maybe the salinity is important we've heard oxygen left levels are very important for for marine life.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:13.000
And well, there are various models that we can we can use to model all these these parameters, but of course they also need to be quantified with measurements of the of the field.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Next slide, please, and then I would like to Give it over to Stephan, who's going to tell you a bit more on the effects of sacrificial announce and Icp.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Yes, thank you, Nick. yes, I will briefly touch upon.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:48.000
The internal chemistry of monopoly, because it was already described before, especially by Monica, very nicely in a presentation that the inside of the monopiles can have a very distinct

01:19:48.000 --> 01:20:00.000
chemical nature, and especially the effect of Catholic protection, is very important, and the effect of sacrificial annals can be zinc or aluminum emissions.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:13.000
This can, of course, be toxic. The The question is, to what extent that really is the case in in practice? I think that that is really an interesting research question.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:23.000
On the other end. If you have I speed systems instead of sacrificial annotes, then different types of phenomena occur.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:39.000
First of all, the ph close to the announce you can drop whereas the ph along the steel service rises, and this can create a related effects.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:58.000
And also when the potential system is not well, fine tuned gas formation can occur, especially chlorine and bromine, which can in their part be converted to other species which can have deteriorated effects

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000
well and and well, there are some knowledge on the internal of monopiles.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:12.000
I Here I give an example from from literature. maybe next slide can be shown.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Yes, thank you. here the right top show some well schematic profiles for a couple of importance.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:33.000
A chemical physical parameters, such as temperature oxygen connectivity.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:42.000
So something is known about these parameters. however, the obtaining of of local and measurement.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Information can be quite a challenge in these environments, and of course this is a very important thing to do.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:56.000
So more obtaining more. monitoring data is very important.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And then, of course, oxygen was already mentioned a couple of times which is very important.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Parameter. it was thoughts for some time that in inside a close monopoly oxygen which quickly go to 0 it was not as black as white as that.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000
In many cases there was some leakage or transport.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:30.000
A scene and there's a lot of data which shows also that in many cases oxygen doesn't go.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Don't go to 0 easily in close system systems however.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Another important issue is also not not only to look into the the overall bulk of the internal monopoly, but also look in into certain niches, such as near the sea, floor or other anerobic niches,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:00.000
where a very specific locations can occur or oxygen can really be de be depleted.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:14.000
To 0. and of course, here I I show a picture all around showing back Monica, which very nicely shows that if you have depletion of oxygen replenishment halls can be an interesting

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:21.000
option to to counteract. next slide, please.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000
And I think this slides nicely relates to what Andrew wants.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Very nicely on all kinds of biofounding.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Well, i'm, a microbiologist myself, and I amongst other, I look at to corrosion also in monopiles.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And there you see that inside the monopials, and especially along steel, you can have all kinds of Micronishes.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Where microorganisms like to colonize, and eventually it leads to the the other biofounding processes that Andrew described very nicely.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
And what what is frightening, I think, is that you really also hear?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:16.000
You have to look at the different niches, aerobic, anaerobic, but also different environment. seawater, sediment, sands, and also in the steel service itself, can be very specific chemical environments which leads to

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:31.000
very specific growth. And if you look at the organisms that you find there, and the the the bottom graphs show 2 analysis of of findings in a laboratory setting.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Are we 2 reactors with seawater, and there you can see that you will find a variety of micro microorganisms.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:58.000
There And also if you compare the the left and the right graph, you see a difference when you go to the seawater or to still surface in that sea water, the specific niche will create a specific

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:06.000
bio bio film and a specific group of organisms Colin, I see.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:14.000
So with that. Well, that's very briefly going into micro microbiology, which is eventually leading to to other organisms as well.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:22.000
But just to touch upon it. With that I want to pass the pressitation back to Nick and go to next slide.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Please. Yeah, Thanks. Stephan, as introduced by Stephen.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:35.000
There's a couple of well downsides to adding Catholic protection to your monopoly.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Besides protecting it against corrosion, of course, but especially with icps.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:52.000
What we've seen is that the ph drops and that this can, and that they dangerous guesses can occur and these need to be ventilated, or the water needs to be replaced replenish.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:06.000
So what we've seen so far in the offshore wind industry is that in the design water replenishment holes are added in the well in in the part of the monopoly below the meeting sea level and that

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Eric management holes are applied somewhere above the the water level, but below the air type platform

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:26.000
And these designs can, of course, be optimized because the unsteady marine environment, such as the way it's the diet and the current.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:37.000
They drive basically, together with the orientation of those holes in the size of those holes, how much water and air is flowing in and out of your monopoly?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
What was touched on by by Andrew as well.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.000
So we have very limited information about marine growth.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:55.000
And then the Dv guideline that he showed was even only talking about marine growth on a vertical surface.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:05.000
If you can imagine that the steel monopoly like this, with maybe 8 diameters the steel is about is almost 10 cm stick.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:21.000
So inside of your oval hole which you make. there is basically also a horizontal surface of about about 10 cm, which is also then exposed to quite significant flow philosophies.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:31.000
About what type of species in such an environment will thrive or and whether it will be a hard, substrate, or something soft and help firm will build.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:46.000
It will be there's quite, quite limited actually no and we do try to make an assistant estimation on what it does eventually for your water replenishment, because we want to know how much new seawater

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
flushes in with with with each waves.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:28:06.000
So, as Stefan also said, a lot of lot of new ids for additional research or surveying offshore to to get more insight into this, and then we can see whether or not we can optimize if read this

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:17.000
replenishment and and corrosion, protection system, and maybe even add the the nature inclusive design.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So let's see if we can optimize this for certain species of thought.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Let me go to the next slide, please. so what we've done within the Paris is done.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:44.000
A couple of physical model test you can see where a blue dye was placed inside of a a monopoly and that in this case there is only a type going up and up and down and there's a

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:55.000
current, and because the internal free surface is allowed to well, the holes are that big, that that internally the water is moving at the same at the same place and outward.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000
That is basically as sort of a bumping cylinder. It's pumping in and out the content of the cylinder.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:12.000
In terms of volume, and what you would see if you add waves that the amount of water being replenished even a lot faster.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:23.000
What we've done is we've made a a von a simple hyodynamic model which which we can evaluate the amount of water that with replenished.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Do you decide? and ways in which we take into account the vertical location of the holes, and also the orientation with with respect to the current and with respect to the ways?

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000
What we then can do with this information that's on the next slide, I believe.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Although this was a precisely simplistic I dynamic model, we can also do detailed CD models, because what we see in some cases is that if you're in a certain storm condition, the ways get really

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
high. If you then have quite significant, more replenishment.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Holes like you sometimes see with the cable entry holes which are up to a up to a meter in diameter, that there's such a significant flow through the these water replenishment holes that you get

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:27.000
jet flows up to 10 meters per second i'm I'm really wondering whether or not a God sitting inside of your monopoly will like it.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:40.000
If there is a jet. But what you can also see from this detailed analysis is that actually outside of the area close to your whole, the flow is Is not that significant?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.000
So there is shelter inside of this it's sort of this march.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Offshore structure. Then now next slide that's regarding the water quality model, we've seen from various people the the that some of the parameters of the seawater offshore are very important to

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:13.000
promote certain habitats for for for instance, God, or lobster, or some other organisms.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:30.000
What we can do with the water quality model is that by taking the water which is flushing in and out of our monopoly we feed this into the Del Walk, which is a Delta s built water quality model and with that we can

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.000
model, basically all of the chemical processes, including the Icp.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Inside of your monopoly, and then look at the effect on, for instance, Ph.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:48.000
The dissolved oxygen, and all those other parameters which are important for the for nature.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.000
What you see here on the on the lower left is first

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
The S. signal, so that's the significant wave height over time for C.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And as well. and that's for 4 4 months.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:19.000
And what you see in the top part, the more or less blue figure you can see a couple of red lines and red lines indicate the location of a icano, and then there is 2 white lines.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
And I hope those are visible, and add those 2 white lines.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:36.000
There is a replenishment, hole and we can see there's a button that's the the sea floor, and then there's mean sea level, and what we can see over time is the change in ph level in the bulk of

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:46.000
the water over the vertical depth. So we can see, for instance, that after the first of May there is a quiet period.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:53.000
There are hardly any waves, and we can see that, especially near the bottom, below the lowest water replenishment hole.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:08.000
The ph drops quite significantly, and what we can combine this knowledge with is, for instance, what's nature species like to settle at what period in time?

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:20.000
And then we can see whether or not a certain water branchment and Catholic protection system designed in for offshore wind, is then a typical applicable for such a species.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Then I have one final slide the next one, and then we can go over to discussions.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:38.000
So. I said this one indeed! regarding dissolved oxygen.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000
But I think I think this was already mentioned by a couple of the colleagues.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Is that the oxygen over time will be variable and it's affected by marine growth and the clogging up of those holes?

01:33:52.000 --> 01:34:00.000
So if the holes are clogged up significantly then there's less new seawater coming in

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
And besides that, there is also a demand, of course, of oxygen.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:15.000
If you get more species and more biomass inside of your inside of your modern path, that those who also have a larger uptake of oxygen, and there might be some kind of a balance.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:22.000
And I think that's it a couple of thanks for the discussion on the next slide.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000
But thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Nick.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Thank you very much to fun. if we have one short question we'll take it.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:39.000
But then, otherwise we're going to turn it over to Jeff

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
So, Jeff, I think that means what we'll do is we'll

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Jeff will finish it off, etc. and then as part of that.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:56.000
We'll have a little bit of time. hopefully for some broader discussion, and for that questions to any of the people that presented, either in part, one or part 2.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000
So over to you, Jeff. Okay, Thanks, Dan. And Ashley first.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Thank you, Dan, for bringing us all together, because it's just been a fascinating hour, and so many minutes, and I think the reassuring thing is all the joint knowledge from everyone who's presented really gives us an avenue

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:24.000
to make better decisions. As we move forward so I'm Jeff swaying professor of ocean engineering at Florida's due to technology.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Monica Mayor, who you just recently heard from and cake. go on just very important in the research.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000
We've done, and and the knowledge we gained so our interest really is.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Now you know, how do we manage the interactions between marine growth and internal order?

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Chemistry, and it's really falling on from Nixon Stefan's presentations.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:36:00.000
How are we going to do this? And the way I look at it is to say, Well, how do we perceive marine growth and the associated formula?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
And typically as an engineer you look upon to just buy a founding.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.000
And it's something you want to control is something you want to maybe prevent.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000
And the picture on the right is some blue muscle fowling of actually a seawater intake.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Taking the naturally the late seventies or seawater intake to one of the North Se oil platforms.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
But I think nowadays we try and look upon it more as ecology, and really as engineers.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.000
How can we design to enhance and nurture nature?

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And again, the little picture on the right is the Lafilia potU.S.A. deep sea coral, and the already is that again, in the sixties and seventies troll is basically decimated.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:50.000
These deep sea color, coral reefs, and the arrival of the North Sea oil structures gave them a habitat.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:37:00.000
And I understand these corals, and now flourishing on the on the oil and gas structures in the North Sea, and then finally, marriculture.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Can we use these structures in any way to benefit?

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:24.000
See, creature production. The next slide Well, I think we've heard so much about this, and the previous talkers have, really given us a great insight into the factors that influenced the biology of the internal

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:36.000
space. So we look at it in terms of the structure. the monopile, the chemistry inside. And then if you have openings, what's the ball is gonna do?

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.000
And then, finally, how does this all interact with corrosion?

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:47.000
And in the brief time I have available to me. If you look at the monopile, what are I going to be focusing on?

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Is the dimensions. what is the influence of different diameters on the volume to surface area?

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:03.000
When we look at chemistry i'm just going to focus on oxygen, oxygen is a prerequisite for life.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:15.000
And so, if we want to look at it as a means to control by a founding, we reduce the oxygen. if we want to look at it in terms of ecological enhancement or maric culture, we obviously want to

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
have a oxygen concentrations to support life.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:28.000
The biology. Well, we need to understand that as Andrew so well taught us, and basically anticipating what will grow there.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:48.000
And the final diagram on the right kind of adventurous. to me it was actually comes from a researcher in the seventys casta in 1974, and he basically defined the marine environment in terms of the redox potential which you see on

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:59.000
the Y-axis in terms of potential and ph. It was sort of a poor bay diagram for the marine environment and the little encircled area.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000
There is what we really like to work with is oceanic water.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:10.000
What we found in in the enclosed monopiles which have had Catholic protection.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
You're getting more into the lower ph so it'd be more to the left.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Maybe aidic corrosion pits. and then, if you get into the microbial in juice corrosion, then you get into the Anoxica marine environments. So these sort of environments are fairly well

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000
defined, and very well categorized. but as I said for the short time I have.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I'm just gonna really focus on on oxygen. So next slide. one of the things that fascinates me is, if you look at the monot pile internal space and you look at it with respect again the

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Y-axis is volume in cubic meters to surface area and square meters.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.000
And you look at how these relate one to another with monopile diameter.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:03.000
You can see that the volume increases exponentially as you increase diameter.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:08.000
But the relationship to surface area is linear one. You might ask.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Well, why is his important? Well, when you think of it the surface area determines that's where the reactions occur.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000
It may be the reduction of oxygen with the corrosion reaction.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:28.000
It may be the reactions developing Catholic chalks which occur when you apply Catholic protection.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:43.000
But now, when we introduce biology, we're talking about metabolism and we're talking about respiration, and these reactants are supplied by the volume, so my sort of hypothesis is the larger

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:56.000
diameter of monopiles will have a larger volume to surface area ratio, and therefore, when we look at it in terms of oxygen depletion, it will be slower for the larger diamond of piles and

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I think the important thing to realize is we cannot treat I believe all multip piles the same.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:15.000
There's gonna be a dynamics there that's going to be determined by the interactions of the volume and the surface area next slide.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:30.000
And so when we look at dissolved oxygen there's been a lot of research and trying to understand if you like, the anaerobic and depleted ocean. space. and only you left you have a a figure that

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
basically shows the interactions with oxygen saturation.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Say 7 to 8 milligrams, the leader for normal and good biological activity right down to 0 when we're getting into the anaerobic environment. and I should acknowledge the Virginia institute and bring sciences for this

01:41:49.000 --> 01:42:00.000
for this figure. So basically we now have a captured body of water, and what we want to do is to ensure that it is both a healthy environment.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:18.000
If we're gonna put in a openings into the environment for the biology, and also that it doesn't go into the very low oxygen regime. So about 0 point 2 milligrams, the leader where you start to get

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:24.000
hydrogen sulfide and aerobic activities sulfate, reducing bacteria, etc.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:34.000
I one of the nice things about monica's research, and you've already seen this figure. A couple of times is Now we're looking at the dissolved oxygen and milligrams.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000
The leader on the Y-axis, and the duration of her experiment on the X-axis.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:58.000
And if you look at the perforated pipes you'll see that as the biofounding started, or the biology started to develop on the inside of the pipe sections, we actually saw depletion of the

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:07.000
oxygen, and with Monica already said, we assume that was due to the sort of respiration, activity of the organisms.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:24.000
And so when we design perforations, we can either design them that maintain a dissolved oxygen level that is healthy for marine life, or actually been designed, and to limit the ingress of oxygen maybe to

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:29.000
control by a family, and that is, are you designing green?

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Biology is firefounding. Or are you designing these structures to enhance ecology?

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Next slide. Well, how does this relate to real life and this is a bit of a

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:55.000
I don't take this graph 2 literally but what i've said is okay, Michael Sedulus, the blue muscle.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000
What is the time to reduce oxygen to 2 milligrams?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:03.000
The leader due to respiration, and on the x-axis we have pile diameter.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I've assumed an oxygen concentration in the ambient sea water, 7 milligrams per leader.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I've assumed a muscle. respiration of about point 6 milligrams per hour and a muscle density of 400 individuals per square meter.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I've assumed there's a linear relationship between never happens in the real world with real biology.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:38.000
But the point i'm trying to make is the pile diameter does matter, and it does matter because of the volume to surface area ratio, and how the reactants and the products of the reactions basically a buffet by the

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:44.000
volume of seawater in which they are operating.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Next slide. So where do we go? I mean as i've already? said Dan.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Thank you so much. I mean all these talks have been very enlightening, and I think it really gives us hope that our combined knowledge can really start to.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Come up with some good models to manage the internal space.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:20.000
But to have models, you Need Numbers and so ourselves Dan joeling Don from Tufts and Colleen Lena and Loretta from the Woodshole Institute.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000
We're gonna take monica's initial experimental design.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000
We're gonna deploy some of these pipes up at the woods whole Institute.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:35.000
We're gonna have another series down here with ourselves in Florida, and we're gonna try and get more data.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Basically that measures the impact of perforations on Catholic protection.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Pretty and biophowing impacts of quoting on Catholic protection corrosion and biofounding, and then measure the impact of the biology on the conditions in the pipe and on the catholic

01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:09.000
protection systems. So that is all. I have try and merge the management with our knowledge and how we design these structures basically to perform well from a corrosion perspective.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:18.000
And also maybe to act as a means to enhance the offshore ecology.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:28.000
So. Thank you, Dan. everyone, thank you, Jeff and John if you'll just go one more slide forward.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000
That would be great. and so we do have a little bit of time, you know.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:47.000
12 min for a little bit of discussion. so I put the agenda back up on here, so that you can see the for you know the titles for the 4 presentations on part one and also what we discussed in part 2 what

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000
the research team is very keen is to sort of get your thoughts.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Get your ideas about what we should be doing next. Obviously It's exciting to hear about what industry is doing.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.000
You know, with Ursa's example that is tremendous you know, with Andrew, with the studies that he's engaged in.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:11.000
But obviously everybody who spoke today is their area of science or their area of leadership is critically important.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:17.000
In order to ensure sort of responsible development and nature inclusive design.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:24.000
And I think there is a sense as described that certainly we can do this, but we and and be effective.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:40.000
But the science is complex. there's an incredible number of interactions, and we need to do additional work in order to understand it sufficiently, so that we can do nature inclusive design with predictable results.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:53.000
And so right in the chat what i'm going to do is i'm going, i'm about to pay the survey that you would have seen before is distributed by email to get your thoughts on a few items but we do

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:09.000
have 10 or so minutes for some direct discussion now, and those can be questions to any of the people that spoke, or ideas you have, or thoughts that you know have been generated that you would like to share with the those who are on the line together

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:23.000
so i'll stop talking there and we'll see how it goes. And, John, my suggestion is maybe that we stop sharing, and so that those people who want to engage in this conversation and ask questions.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:37.000
We can see all the people in that way

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:51.000
So, Peter, you have a question. Go ahead. yeah. And the question is, in what the extent are these results?

01:48:51.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Side specific. so do we. have to carry out side specific investigations in each situation.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:12.000
So i'm talking, of course, about baltic sea and Northeast and others are talking about completely different areas of the world.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:23.000
This is my general question. I don't know who wants to answer that this

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Dan. This is Jeff. I could give it a go so I think it's a very good question, and I think Andrew alluded to that when he showed the ecosystems of the world, and you're quite right both

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:42.000
in terms of seawater chemistry in terms of biology.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:49.000
There are a great deal of differences if you look at it just in terms of the Dnv.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Recommended practice for Catholic protection, for example, they, their practice will recommend, different design for for different sea areas just based on the oxygen, concentration, seawater conductivity, etc., and I think when we

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:15.000
get into the biology, we have a an equal differential to to to make.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:24.000
So that would be my input I think it's a very good question

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:33.000
I can just add, Yeah, i'd say that yeah I mean we have They're all a lot of knowledge gaps that do exist in certain areas.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
We do all see, Understand? the biology and the chemistry better.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Some areas of much better studied other areas, much less So I think.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Another issue, too, of course, is is having databases where which make it a facilitate this knowledge to be shared.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:58.000
This is something, I think, is Japanese industry can be approved

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:05.000
And John, you had a comment or, yeah, I guess my apologies.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Since I had the slides up i've been able to Monitor Chat.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000
But one thing I wanted to ask the group what we have a large group people here is

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:18.000
I know I've been following for a while and I know different countries in Europe have different requirements.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Regards to like the corrosion protection system, particularly on anode selection, and, like I believe, it's partly tied to the environmental aspects of it, wondering if particularly for like internal water

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:35.000
columns. If there's any potential concerns with like higher levels of sync or higher levels of aluminum.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:46.000
If you use some kind of galvanic system internally, I know I've got one reference to talks about potentially having to investigate how you know interacts with the food web But i'm wondering if anyone has

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:58.000
any experience or knowledge in that space

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Stefan. Nick, you guys, I would look to you actually to say something about this.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Yeah, I I was just pressing on on mute but I I know there have been some studies into this.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:28.000
A couple of papers have occurred and I I don't know i'm no them by by art, but what the outcome was for aluminum the effect is not as critical as for zinc because a large part of

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:34.000
it actually precipitates and and becomes a non vice versa.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:52.000
However, I I would recommend to to to make a no view of these papers that that occurred, and I also know of a project that Delta artists was was involved in where in general environmental emissions from offshore

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:59.000
wind activities were explored, and and well, what I heard from colleagues was that the Em?

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:09.000
The the impacts were relatively low still so so that that's that's optimistic at least, but of course it did.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:22.000
The I. We discussed this with with colleagues also last week, and what is very important also in public acceptance is that, that that clear data is shown on the effects.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:29.000
So that, when with regards to to to mentioned metals, of course.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:47.000
The idea is about it stops toxic and effects and It's very important, then, to come up with detailed knowledge about this and and one other thing is because I saw in in in in the in the meantime questioner one

01:53:47.000 --> 01:54:06.000
of the questions. Race was already if there are negative effects should shoot this as should offshore winds be limited or well, and I think an important thing is to that. there's a lot of things that can be

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000
done with mitigation, and also the choice for different.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:29.000
If you, for instance, look for corrosion protection options that you have, you have different choices, and And so, even if you come to the conclusion that certain options have that consequences for the environment in many cases there

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:38.000
are also options to choose for different types of protection systems or to juice, a way to to to mitigate effects.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:45.000
And I think that that's very important sorry about the long answer.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:55:00.000
But lots of interesting things to thank you jeff we'll give you a sort of maybe a last word there, and then i'll just make a closing comment, and we'll complete the workshop Yeah, I was curious how

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:11.000
widely have the water replenishment. holes been embraced in Europe and have people going back and Retro fitted if you like holes into existing structures.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:17.000
So I don't know if this is a question for Nick and Stephan, or or anyone else out there.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Thank you. I think I can. I can take that one. I think.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.000
In general the one report management holes has been quite widely accepted.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:37.000
What we see in current offshore in monopoly retrofitting of holes in one of files have not seen, because it's.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000
I I can imagine that it's a quite an impossible task I would say,

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.000
What we do have heard of in some cases is that

01:55:48.000 --> 01:56:10.000
By using both the water management holes and the the the really new and innovative coatings is that people wait with applying Icp: So they make a design for certain monopoly with replenishment holes.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:16.000
And that the Icp system is actually only later deployed.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:30.000
In some cases you might have a combination of Catholic protection with sexual and nodes, which are there first and then later applying Icp.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Because you can imagine the Ip only works by the time you have power, and the foundation goes in at the start of your project.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:48.000
So you have to bridge a gap either by applying a really good coating or having a sacrificial announcement in place.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.000
That's a that's at least microns state of what?

01:56:53.000 --> 01:57:00.000
What design looks like Nick. thank you very much and since we're 1 min away.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
What i'll do is i'll have a little bit of closure.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:10.000
First of all, thank you to the speakers. That was really, you know my opinion, really amazing and inspiring.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:18.000
So much promise for the future. And so obviously this workshop was not about result.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Getting to all the technical details when Jeff and I were talking about this a day or so ago, who was saying, You know, looking at everybody presenting what we need as a 2 day workshop.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000
So we do look forward to your ideas. so what would make sense for

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.000
The next steps in this and we'll be working on ideas and trying to get.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:42.000
I proposals out there to to get the community together on a number of these items.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
So there is a survey. Please complete it if you can.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:59.000
The there will be another workshop and about a month that's going to be looking at structural aspects associated with the use of perforations, and what might be an optimal level as some of you may know there's

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:12.000
investigations under. Oh, if you look at large diameter monop piles in deep water, their design is controlled by waveloading, and so people are looking at the impact of perforations on reducing the peaks of the

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
waveloads by distributing it out over a course of time.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:23.000
As Dtars mentioned. You know, if you have small holes, you can get water jets at 10 meters per second.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:31.000
If you completely open it up a large amount the wave just goes through. And so we've been in conversation with some fabricators about what might be an optimal level.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:37.000
So we'll be getting into some of the structural design issues, stress concentrations, buckling when you have perforations, etc.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:48.000
In the next workshop. we'll probably have a one after that which is starting to look at what types of field and laboratory studies are needed to further advance the science.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:59:00.000
So my sincere appreci gratitude to everybody who put in so much time today, and for everybody else who came and participated in the workshop. we'll do our best to answer all your questions.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:15.000
I'm gonna leave the zoom open for a couple of minutes, so that people have the opportunity to share some thoughts that may have come to mind some questions that they didn't get a chance to ask etc. But Otherwise I know people are going

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:22.000
to be disappearing. So thank you again to everyone

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Thank you so much. Bye bye, Thanks, Jan. Thank you, Dan.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Thanks for organizing. Thank you. Thank you. Nice nice date

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Great job in

01:59:43.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Thanks a lot. See you all
